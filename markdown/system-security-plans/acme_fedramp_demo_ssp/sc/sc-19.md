# sc-19 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Voice Over Internet Protocol

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and

- \[b.\] Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of VoIP within the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-19(a)\]

  - \[SC-19(a)[1]\] establishes usage restrictions for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously;
  - \[SC-19(a)[2]\] establishes implementation guidance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously;

- \[SC-19(b)\]

  - \[SC-19(b)[1]\] authorizes the use of VoIP within the information system;
  - \[SC-19(b)[2]\] monitors the use of VoIP within the information system; and
  - \[SC-19(b)[3]\] controls the use of VoIP within the information system.
