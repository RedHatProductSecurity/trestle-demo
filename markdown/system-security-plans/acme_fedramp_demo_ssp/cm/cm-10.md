# cm-10 - \[Configuration Management\] Software Usage Restrictions

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Uses software and associated documentation in accordance with contract agreements and copyright laws;

- \[b.\] Tracks the use of software and associated documentation protected by quantity licenses to control copying and distribution; and

- \[c.\] Controls and documents the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-10(a)\] uses software and associated documentation in accordance with contract agreements and copyright laws;

- \[CM-10(b)\] tracks the use of software and associated documentation protected by quantity licenses to control copying and distribution; and

- \[CM-10(c)\] controls and documents the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.

## Control guidance

Software license tracking can be accomplished by manual methods (e.g., simple spreadsheets) or automated methods (e.g., specialized tracking applications) depending on organizational needs.
