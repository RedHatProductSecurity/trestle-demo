# ia-5.11 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Hardware Token-based Authentication

## Control Statement

The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy [organization-defined token quality requirements].

## Control Objective

Determine if, for hardware token-based authentication:

- \[IA-5(11)[1]\] the organization defines token quality requirements to be satisfied; and

- \[IA-5(11)[2]\] the information system employs mechanisms that satisfy organization-defined token quality requirements.

## Control guidance

Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of PKI-based tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card. Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI.
