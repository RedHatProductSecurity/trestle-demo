# ac-21 - \[Access Control\] Information Sharing

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information for [organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user discretion is required]; and

- \[b.\] Employs [organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-21(a)\]

  - \[AC-21(a)[1]\] defines information sharing circumstances where user discretion is required;
  - \[AC-21(a)[2]\] facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information for organization-defined information sharing circumstances;

- \[AC-21(b)\]

  - \[AC-21(b)[1]\] defines automated mechanisms or manual processes to be employed to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions; and
  - \[AC-21(b)[2]\] employs organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions.

## Control guidance

This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner (e.g., privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information, personally identifiable information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments) based on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular information-sharing circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program/compartment.
