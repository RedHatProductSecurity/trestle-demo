# ac-11.1 - \[Access Control\] Pattern-hiding Displays

## Control Statement

The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

## Control guidance

Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey sensitive information.
