# sa-2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Allocation of Resources

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Determines information security requirements for the information system or information system service in mission/business process planning;

- \[b.\] Determines, documents, and allocates the resources required to protect the information system or information system service as part of its capital planning and investment control process; and

- \[c.\] Establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational programming and budgeting documentation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-2(a)\] determines information security requirements for the information system or information system service in mission/business process planning;

- \[SA-2(b)\] to protect the information system or information system service as part of its capital planning and investment control process:

  - \[SA-2(b)[1]\] determines the resources required;
  - \[SA-2(b)[2]\] documents the resources required;
  - \[SA-2(b)[3]\] allocates the resources required; and

- \[SA-2(c)\] establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational programming and budgeting documentation.

## Control guidance

Resource allocation for information security includes funding for the initial information system or information system service acquisition and funding for the sustainment of the system/service.
