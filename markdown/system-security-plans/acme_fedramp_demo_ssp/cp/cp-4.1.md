# cp-4.1 - \[Contingency Planning\] Coordinate with Related Plans

## Control Statement

The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.

## Control guidance

Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with specific plans. It does require, however, that if such organizational elements are responsible for related plans, organizations should coordinate with those elements.
