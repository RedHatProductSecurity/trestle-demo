# pl-4.1 - \[Planning\] Social Media and Networking Restrictions

## Control Statement

The organization includes in the rules of behavior, explicit restrictions on the use of social media/networking sites and posting organizational information on public websites.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization includes the following in the rules of behavior:

- \[PL-4(1)[1]\] explicit restrictions on the use of social media/networking sites; and

- \[PL-4(1)[2]\] posting organizational information on public websites.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses rules of behavior related to the use of social media/networking sites: (i) when organizational personnel are using such sites for official duties or in the conduct of official business; (ii) when organizational information is involved in social media/networking transactions; and (iii) when personnel are accessing social media/networking sites from organizational information systems. Organizations also address specific rules that prevent unauthorized entities from obtaining and/or inferring non-public organizational information (e.g., system account information, personally identifiable information) from social media/networking sites.
