# si-8 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Spam Protection

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Employs spam protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and take action on unsolicited messages; and

- \[b.\] Updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-8(a)\] employs spam protection mechanisms:

  - \[SI-8(a)[1]\] at information system entry points to detect unsolicited messages;
  - \[SI-8(a)[2]\] at information system entry points to take action on unsolicited messages;
  - \[SI-8(a)[3]\] at information system exit points to detect unsolicited messages;
  - \[SI-8(a)[4]\] at information system exit points to take action on unsolicited messages; and

- \[SI-8(b)\] updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.

## Control guidance

Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, mobile devices, and notebook/laptop computers. Spam can be transported by different means including, for example, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection mechanisms include, for example, signature definitions.
