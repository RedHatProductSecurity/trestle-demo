# ps-8 - \[Personnel Security\] Personnel Sanctions

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Employs a formal sanctions process for individuals failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures; and

- \[b.\] Notifies organization-defined personnel or roles within organization-defined time period when a formal employee sanctions process is initiated, identifying the individual sanctioned and the reason for the sanction.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-8(a)\] employs a formal sanctions process for individuals failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures;

- \[PS-8(b)\]

  - \[PS-8(b)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be notified when a formal employee sanctions process is initiated;
  - \[PS-8(b)[2]\] defines the time period within which organization-defined personnel or roles must be notified when a formal employee sanctions process is initiated; and
  - \[PS-8(b)[3]\] notifies organization-defined personnel or roles within the organization-defined time period when a formal employee sanctions process is initiated, identifying the individual sanctioned and the reason for the sanction.

## Control guidance

Organizational sanctions processes reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Sanctions processes are described in access agreements and can be included as part of general personnel policies and procedures for organizations. Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding matters of employee sanctions.
