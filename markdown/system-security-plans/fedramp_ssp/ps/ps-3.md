# ps-3 - \[Personnel Security\] Personnel Screening

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system; and

- \[b.\] Rescreens individuals according to organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of such rescreening.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-3(a)\] screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system;

- \[PS-3(b)\]

  - \[PS-3(b)[1]\] defines conditions requiring re-screening;
  - \[PS-3(b)[2]\] defines the frequency of re-screening where it is so indicated; and
  - \[PS-3(b)[3]\] re-screens individuals in accordance with organization-defined conditions requiring re-screening and, where re-screening is so indicated, with the organization-defined frequency of such re-screening.

## Control guidance

Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems.
