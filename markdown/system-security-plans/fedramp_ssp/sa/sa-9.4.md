# sa-9.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Consistent Interests of Consumers and Providers

## Control Statement

The organization employs organization-defined security safeguards to ensure that the interests of organization-defined external service providers are consistent with and reflect organizational interests.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-9(4)[1]\] defines external service providers whose interests are to be consistent with and reflect organizational interests;

- \[SA-9(4)[2]\] defines security safeguards to be employed to ensure that the interests of organization-defined external service providers are consistent with and reflect organizational interests; and

- \[SA-9(4)[3]\] employs organization-defined security safeguards to ensure that the interests of organization-defined external service providers are consistent with and reflect organizational interests.

## Control guidance

As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the possibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational safeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control those safeguards are not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations. Possible actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include, for example, requiring background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining ownership records, employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which organizations have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to service provider facilities.
