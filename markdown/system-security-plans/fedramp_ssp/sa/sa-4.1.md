# sa-4.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Functional Properties of Security Controls

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the security controls to be employed.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the security controls to be employed.

## Control guidance

Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality (i.e., security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls.
