# au-4 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Storage Capacity

## Control Statement

The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with organization-defined audit record storage requirements.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-4[1]\] defines audit record storage requirements; and

- \[AU-4[2]\] allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with the organization-defined audit record storage requirements.

## Control guidance

Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.
