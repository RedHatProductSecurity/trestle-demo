# au-6.1 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Process Integration

## Control Statement

The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to support organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.

## Control Objective

  - \[AU-6(1)[1][a]\] audit review;
  - \[AU-6(1)[1][b]\] analysis;
  - \[AU-6(1)[1][c]\] reporting processes;

- \[AU-6(1)[2]\] uses integrated audit review, analysis and reporting processes to support organizational processes for:

  - \[AU-6(1)[2][a]\] investigation of suspicious activities; and
  - \[AU-6(1)[2][b]\] response to suspicious activities.

## Control guidance

Organizational processes benefiting from integrated audit review, analysis, and reporting include, for example, incident response, continuous monitoring, contingency planning, and Inspector General audits.
