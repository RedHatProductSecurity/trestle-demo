# au-6 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Reviews and analyzes information system audit records organization-defined frequency for indications of organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity; and

- \[b.\] Reports findings to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-6(a)\]

  - \[AU-6(a)[1]\] defines the types of inappropriate or unusual activity to look for when information system audit records are reviewed and analyzed;
  - \[AU-6(a)[2]\] defines the frequency to review and analyze information system audit records for indications of organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity;
  - \[AU-6(a)[3]\] reviews and analyzes information system audit records for indications of organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity with the organization-defined frequency;

- \[AU-6(b)\]

  - \[AU-6(b)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to whom findings resulting from reviews and analysis of information system audit records are to be reported; and
  - \[AU-6(b)[2]\] reports findings to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include, for example, incident response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority.
