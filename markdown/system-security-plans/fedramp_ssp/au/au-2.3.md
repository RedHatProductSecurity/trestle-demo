# au-2.3 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Reviews and Updates

## Control Statement

The organization reviews and updates the audited events [organization-defined frequency].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-2(3)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the audited events; and

- \[AU-2(3)[2]\] reviews and updates the auditable events with organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Over time, the events that organizations believe should be audited may change. Reviewing and updating the set of audited events periodically is necessary to ensure that the current set is still necessary and sufficient.
Annually or whenever changes in the threat environment are communicated to the service provider by the JAB/AO.
