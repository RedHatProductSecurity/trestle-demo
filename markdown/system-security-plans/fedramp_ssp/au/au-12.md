# au-12 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Generation

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a.\] Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at organization-defined information system components;

- \[b.\] Allows organization-defined personnel or roles to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and

- \[c.\] Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-12(a)\]

  - \[AU-12(a)[1]\] the organization defines the information system components which are to provide audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2a;
  - \[AU-12(a)[2]\] the information system provides audit record generation capability, for the auditable events defined in AU-2a, at organization-defined information system components;

- \[AU-12(b)\]

  - \[AU-12(b)[1]\] the organization defines the personnel or roles allowed to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system;
  - \[AU-12(b)[2]\] the information system allows the organization-defined personnel or roles to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the system; and

- \[AU-12(c)\] the information system generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2d with the content in defined in AU-3.

## Control guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different information system components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit records.
