# ac-10 - \[Access Control\] Concurrent Session Control

## Control Statement

The information system limits the number of concurrent sessions for each organization-defined account and/or account type to organization-defined number.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-10[1]\] the organization defines account and/or account types for the information system;

- \[AC-10[2]\] the organization defines the number of concurrent sessions to be allowed for each organization-defined account and/or account type; and

- \[AC-10[3]\] the information system limits the number of concurrent sessions for each organization-defined account and/or account type to the organization-defined number of concurrent sessions allowed.

## Control guidance

Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user, non-privileged user, domain, specific application), by account, or a combination. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. This control addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.
