# ac-2.4 - \[Access Control\] Automated Audit Actions

## Control Statement

The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and notifies organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-2(4)[1]\] the information system automatically audits the following account actions:

  - \[AC-2(4)[1][a]\] creation;
  - \[AC-2(4)[1][b]\] modification;
  - \[AC-2(4)[1][c]\] enabling;
  - \[AC-2(4)[1][d]\] disabling;
  - \[AC-2(4)[1][e]\] removal;

- \[AC-2(4)[2]\] the organization defines personnel or roles to be notified of the following account actions:

  - \[AC-2(4)[2][a]\] creation;
  - \[AC-2(4)[2][b]\] modification;
  - \[AC-2(4)[2][c]\] enabling;
  - \[AC-2(4)[2][d]\] disabling;
  - \[AC-2(4)[2][e]\] removal;

- \[AC-2(4)[3]\] the information system notifies organization-defined personnel or roles of the following account actions:

  - \[AC-2(4)[3][a]\] creation;
  - \[AC-2(4)[3][b]\] modification;
  - \[AC-2(4)[3][c]\] enabling;
