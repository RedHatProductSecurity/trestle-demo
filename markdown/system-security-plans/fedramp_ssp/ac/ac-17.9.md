# ac-17.9 - \[Access Control\] Disconnect / Disable Access

## Control Statement

The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system within organization-defined time period.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-17(9)[1]\] defines the time period within which to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system; and

- \[AC-17(9)[2]\] provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system within the organization-defined time period.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability to rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system and/or disable further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality of missions/business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to organizational information systems.
