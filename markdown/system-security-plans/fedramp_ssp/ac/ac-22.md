# ac-22 - \[Access Control\] Publicly Accessible Content

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

- \[b.\] Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

- \[c.\] Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and

- \[d.\] Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information organization-defined frequency and removes such information, if discovered.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-22(a)\] designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

- \[AC-22(b)\] trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

- \[AC-22(c)\] reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included;

- \[AC-22(d)\]

  - \[AC-22(d)[1]\] defines the frequency to review the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information;
  - \[AC-22(d)[2]\] reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[AC-22(d)[3]\] removes nonpublic information from the publicly accessible information system, if discovered.

## Control guidance

In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information systems is covered by organizational policy.
