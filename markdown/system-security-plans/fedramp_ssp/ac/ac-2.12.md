## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Monitors information system accounts for organization-defined atypical usage; and

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-2(12)(a)\]

  - \[AC-2(12)(a)[1]\] defines atypical usage to be monitored for information system accounts;
  - \[AC-2(12)(a)[2]\] monitors information system accounts for organization-defined atypical usage;

- \[AC-2(12)(b)\]

  - \[AC-2(12)(b)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to whom atypical usage of information system accounts are to be reported; and
  - \[AC-2(12)(b)[2]\] reports atypical usage of information system accounts to organization-defined personnel or roles.
