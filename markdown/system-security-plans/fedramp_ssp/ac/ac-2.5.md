# ac-2.5 - \[Access Control\] Inactivity Logout

## Control Statement

The organization requires that users log out when [organization-defined time-period of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-2(5)[1]\] defines either the time period of expected inactivity that requires users to log out or the description of when users are required to log out; and

- \[AC-2(5)[2]\] requires that users log out when the organization-defined time period of inactivity is reached or in accordance with organization-defined description of when to log out.

## Control guidance

Should use a shorter timeframe than AC-12.

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: ac-2.5 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned
