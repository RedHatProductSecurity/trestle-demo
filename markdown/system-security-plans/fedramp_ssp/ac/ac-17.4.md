# ac-17.4 - \[Access Control\] Privileged Commands / Access

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only for [organization-defined needs]; and

- \[(b)\] Documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-17(4)(a)\]

  - \[AC-17(4)(a)[1]\] defines needs to authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access;
  - \[AC-17(4)(a)[2]\] authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only for organization-defined needs; and

- \[AC-17(4)(b)\] documents the rationale for such access in the information system security plan.
