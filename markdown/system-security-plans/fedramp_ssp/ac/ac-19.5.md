# ac-19.5 - \[Access Control\] Full Device / Container-based Encryption

## Control Statement

The organization employs [full-device encryption; container encryption] to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on [organization-defined mobile devices].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-19(5)[1]\] defines mobile devices for which full-device encryption or container encryption is required to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on such devices; and

- \[AC-19(5)[2]\] employs full-device encryption or container encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on organization-defined mobile devices.

## Control guidance

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including for example, encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.
