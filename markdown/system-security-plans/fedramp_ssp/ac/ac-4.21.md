# ac-4.21 - \[Access Control\] Physical / Logical Separation of Information Flows

## Control Statement

The information system separates information flows logically or physically using organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques to accomplish organization-defined required separations by types of information.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-4(21)[1]\] the organization defines the required separations of information flows by types of information;

- \[AC-4(21)[2]\] the organization defines the mechanisms and/or techniques to be used to separate information flows logically or physically; and

- \[AC-4(21)[3]\] the information system separates information flows logically or physically using organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques to accomplish organization-defined required separations by types of information.

## Control guidance

Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance protection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling flow control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable information include, for example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service requests and responses, and information of differing security categories.
