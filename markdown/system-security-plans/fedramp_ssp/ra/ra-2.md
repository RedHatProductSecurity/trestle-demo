# ra-2 - \[Risk Assessment\] Security Categorization

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;

- \[b.\] Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for the information system; and

- \[c.\] Ensures that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews and approves the security categorization decision.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[RA-2(a)\] categorizes information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;

- \[RA-2(b)\] documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for the information system; and

- \[RA-2(c)\] ensures the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews and approves the security categorization decision.

## Control guidance

Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and information systems are comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by organizations facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along with CM-8, mappings to specific information system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.
