## Control Statement

The organization includes as part of security control assessments, organization-defined frequency, announced; unannounced, in-depth monitoring; vulnerability scanning; malicious user testing; insider threat assessment; performance/load testing;  organization-defined other forms of security assessment .

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CA-2(2)[1]\] selects one or more of the following forms of specialized security assessment to be included as part of security control assessments:

  - \[CA-2(2)[1][a]\] in-depth monitoring;
  - \[CA-2(2)[1][b]\] vulnerability scanning;
  - \[CA-2(2)[1][c]\] malicious user testing;
  - \[CA-2(2)[1][d]\] insider threat assessment;
  - \[CA-2(2)[1][e]\] performance/load testing; and/or
  - \[CA-2(2)[1][f]\] other forms of organization-defined specialized security assessment;

- \[CA-2(2)[2]\] defines the frequency for conducting the selected form(s) of specialized security assessment;

- \[CA-2(2)[3]\] defines whether the specialized security assessment will be announced or unannounced; and

- \[CA-2(2)[4]\] conducts announced or unannounced organization-defined forms of specialized security assessments with the organization-defined frequency as part of security control assessments.

## Control guidance

Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and validation) to improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations conduct assessment activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with the organizational risk executive function. Organizations can incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during assessments into vulnerability remediation processes.
