# ca-2.3 - \[Security Assessment and Authorization\] External Organizations

## Control Statement

The organization accepts the results of an assessment of organization-defined information system performed by organization-defined external organization when the assessment meets organization-defined requirements.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CA-2(3)[1]\] defines an information system for which the results of a security assessment performed by an external organization are to be accepted;

- \[CA-2(3)[2]\] defines an external organization from which to accept a security assessment performed on an organization-defined information system;

- \[CA-2(3)[3]\] defines the requirements to be met by a security assessment performed by organization-defined external organization on organization-defined information system; and

- \[CA-2(3)[4]\] accepts the results of an assessment of an organization-defined information system performed by an organization-defined external organization when the assessment meets organization-defined requirements.

## Control guidance

Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for organizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one organization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.
