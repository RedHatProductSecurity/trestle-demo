# cp-4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Contingency Plan Testing

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Tests the contingency plan for the information system organization-defined frequency using organization-defined tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;

- \[b.\] Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

- \[c.\] Initiates corrective actions, if needed.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-4(a)\]

  - \[CP-4(a)[1]\] defines tests to determine the effectiveness of the contingency plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;
  - \[CP-4(a)[2]\] defines a frequency to test the contingency plan for the information system;
  - \[CP-4(a)[3]\] tests the contingency plan for the information system with the organization-defined frequency, using organization-defined tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;

- \[CP-4(b)\] reviews the contingency plan test results; and

- \[CP-4(c)\] initiates corrective actions, if needed.

## Control guidance

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example, walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.
