# cp-7.2 - \[Contingency Planning\] Accessibility

## Control Statement

The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-7(2)[1]\] identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster; and

- \[CP-7(2)[2]\] outlines explicit mitigation actions for such potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster.

## Control guidance

Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational assessments of risk.
