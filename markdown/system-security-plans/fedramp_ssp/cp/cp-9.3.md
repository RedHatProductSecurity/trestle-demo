# cp-9.3 - \[Contingency Planning\] Separate Storage for Critical Information

## Control Statement

The organization stores backup copies of organization-defined critical information system software and other security-related information in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-9(3)[1]\]

  - \[CP-9(3)[1][a]\] defines critical information system software and other security-related information requiring backup copies to be stored in a separate facility; or
  - \[CP-9(3)[1][b]\] defines critical information system software and other security-related information requiring backup copies to be stored in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the operational system; and

- \[CP-9(3)[2]\] stores backup copies of organization-defined critical information system software and other security-related information in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

## Control guidance

Critical information system software includes, for example, operating systems, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. Security-related information includes, for example, organizational inventories of hardware, software, and firmware components. Alternate storage sites typically serve as separate storage facilities for organizations.
