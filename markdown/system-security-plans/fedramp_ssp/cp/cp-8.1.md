# cp-8.1 - \[Contingency Planning\] Priority of Service Provisions

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with organizational availability requirements (including recovery time objectives); and

- \[(b)\] Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-8(1)[1]\] develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with organizational availability requirements (including recovery time objectives as specified in the information system contingency plan); and

- \[CP-8(1)[2]\] requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

## Control guidance

Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority-of-service provisions.
