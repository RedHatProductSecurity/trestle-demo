# si-12 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Handling and Retention

## Control Statement

The organization handles and retains information within the information system and information output from the system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization, in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements:

- \[SI-12[1]\] handles information within the information system;

- \[SI-12[2]\] handles output from the information system;

- \[SI-12[3]\] retains information within the information system; and

- \[SI-12[4]\] retains output from the information system.

## Control guidance

Information handling and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of information, in some cases extending beyond the disposal of information systems. The National Archives and Records Administration provides guidance on records retention.
