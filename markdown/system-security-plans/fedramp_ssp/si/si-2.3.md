# si-2.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Time to Remediate Flaws / Benchmarks for Corrective Actions

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and

- \[(b)\] Establishes organization-defined benchmarks for taking corrective actions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-2(3)(a)\] measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation;

- \[SI-2(3)(b)\]

  - \[SI-2(3)(b)[1]\] defines benchmarks for taking corrective actions; and
  - \[SI-2(3)(b)[2]\] establishes organization-defined benchmarks for taking corrective actions.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires organizations to determine the current time it takes on the average to correct information system flaws after such flaws have been identified, and subsequently establish organizational benchmarks (i.e., time frames) for taking corrective actions. Benchmarks can be established by type of flaw and/or severity of the potential vulnerability if the flaw can be exploited.
