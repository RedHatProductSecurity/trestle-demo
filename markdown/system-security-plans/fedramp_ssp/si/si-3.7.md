# si-3.7 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Nonsignature-based Detection

## Control Statement

The information system implements nonsignature-based malicious code detection mechanisms.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements non signature-based malicious code detection mechanisms.

## Control guidance

Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, the use of heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide safeguards against malicious code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). This control enhancement does not preclude the use of signature-based detection mechanisms.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Add control implementation description here for control si-3.7

### Implementation Status: planned
