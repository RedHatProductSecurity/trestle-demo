# si-4.23 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Host-based Devices

## Control Statement

The organization implements organization-defined host-based monitoring mechanisms at organization-defined information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-4(23)[1]\] defines host-based monitoring mechanisms to be implemented;

- \[SI-4(23)[2]\] defines information system components where organization-defined host-based monitoring is to be implemented; and

- \[SI-4(23)[3]\] implements organization-defined host-based monitoring mechanisms at organization-defined information system components.

## Control guidance

Information system components where host-based monitoring can be implemented include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information technology product developers.
