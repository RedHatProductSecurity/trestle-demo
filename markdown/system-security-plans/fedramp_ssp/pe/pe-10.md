# pe-10 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Emergency Shutoff

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or individual system components in emergency situations;

- \[b.\] Places emergency shutoff switches or devices in [organization-defined location by information system or system component] to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

- \[c.\] Protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-10(a)\] provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or individual system components in emergency situations;

- \[PE-10(b)\]

  - \[PE-10(b)[1]\] defines the location of emergency shutoff switches or devices by information system or system component;
  - \[PE-10(b)[2]\] places emergency shutoff switches or devices in the organization-defined location by information system or system component to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

- \[PE-10(c)\] protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources including, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.
