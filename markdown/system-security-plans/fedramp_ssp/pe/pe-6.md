# pe-6 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Monitoring Physical Access

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Monitors physical access to the facility where the information system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

- \[b.\] Reviews physical access logs organization-defined frequency and upon occurrence of organization-defined events or potential indications of events; and

- \[c.\] Coordinates results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-6(a)\] monitors physical access to the facility where the information system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

- \[PE-6(b)\]

  - \[PE-6(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to review physical access logs;
  - \[PE-6(b)[2]\] defines events or potential indication of events requiring physical access logs to be reviewed;
  - \[PE-6(b)[3]\] reviews physical access logs with the organization-defined frequency and upon occurrence of organization-defined events or potential indications of events; and

- \[PE-6(c)\] coordinates results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.

## Control guidance

Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of and responses to detected physical security incidents. Security incidents include, for example, apparent security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include, for example: (i) accesses outside of normal work hours; (ii) repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed; (iii) accesses for unusual lengths of time; and (iv) out-of-sequence accesses.
