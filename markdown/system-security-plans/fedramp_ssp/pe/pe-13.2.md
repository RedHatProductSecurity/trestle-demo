# pe-13.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Suppression Devices / Systems

## Control Statement

The organization employs fire suppression devices/systems for the information system that provide automatic notification of any activation to organization-defined personnel or roles and organization-defined emergency responders.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-13(2)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be provided automatic notification of any activation of fire suppression devices/systems for the information system;

- \[PE-13(2)[2]\] defines emergency responders to be provided automatic notification of any activation of fire suppression devices/systems for the information system;

- \[PE-13(2)[3]\] employs fire suppression devices/systems for the information system that provide automatic notification of any activation to:

  - \[PE-13(2)[3][a]\] organization-defined personnel or roles; and
  - \[PE-13(2)[3][b]\] organization-defined emergency responders.

## Control guidance

Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders in the event that individuals on the notification list must have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances, for example, to obtain access to facilities where classified operations are taking place or where there are information systems containing classified information.
