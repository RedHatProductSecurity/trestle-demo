# pe-8 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Visitor Access Records

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Maintains visitor access records to the facility where the information system resides for organization-defined time period; and

- \[b.\] Reviews visitor access records organization-defined frequency.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-8(a)\]

  - \[PE-8(a)[1]\] defines the time period to maintain visitor access records to the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-8(a)[2]\] maintains visitor access records to the facility where the information system resides for the organization-defined time period;

- \[PE-8(b)\]

  - \[PE-8(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to review visitor access records; and
  - \[PE-8(b)[2]\] reviews visitor access records with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Visitor access records include, for example, names and organizations of persons visiting, visitor signatures, forms of identification, dates of access, entry and departure times, purposes of visits, and names and organizations of persons visited. Visitor access records are not required for publicly accessible areas.
