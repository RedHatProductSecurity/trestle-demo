# pe-13 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Fire Protection

## Control Statement

The organization employs and maintains fire suppression and detection devices/systems for the information system that are supported by an independent energy source.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-13[1]\] employs fire suppression and detection devices/systems for the information system that are supported by an independent energy source; and

- \[PE-13[2]\] maintains fire suppression and detection devices/systems for the information system that are supported by an independent energy source.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources including, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire suppression and detection devices/systems include, for example, sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, and smoke detectors.
