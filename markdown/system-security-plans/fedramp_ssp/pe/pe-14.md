# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Temperature and Humidity Controls

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at [organization-defined acceptable levels]; and

- \[b.\] Monitors temperature and humidity levels [organization-defined frequency].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-14(a)\]

  - \[PE-14(a)[1]\] defines acceptable temperature levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-14(a)[2]\] defines acceptable humidity levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-14(a)[3]\] maintains temperature levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;
  - \[PE-14(a)[4]\] maintains humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;

- \[PE-14(b)\]

  - \[PE-14(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to monitor temperature levels;
  - \[PE-14(b)[2]\] defines the frequency to monitor humidity levels;
  - \[PE-14(b)[3]\] monitors temperature levels with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[PE-14(b)[4]\] monitors humidity levels with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.
