# pe-2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Physical Access Authorizations

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops, approves, and maintains a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the information system resides;

- \[b.\] Issues authorization credentials for facility access;

- \[c.\] Reviews the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals organization-defined frequency; and

- \[d.\] Removes individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-2(a)\]

  - \[PE-2(a)[1]\] develops a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-2(a)[2]\] approves a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-2(a)[3]\] maintains a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the information system resides;

- \[PE-2(b)\] issues authorization credentials for facility access;

- \[PE-2(c)\]

  - \[PE-2(c)[1]\] defines the frequency to review the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals;
  - \[PE-2(c)[2]\] reviews the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals with the organization-defined frequency; and

- \[PE-2(d)\] removes individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.

## Control guidance

This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization credentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed (including level of forge-proof badges, smart cards, or identification cards) consistent with federal standards, policies, and procedures. This control only applies to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible.
