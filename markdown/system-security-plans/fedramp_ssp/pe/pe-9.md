# pe-9 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Power Equipment and Cabling

## Control Statement

The organization protects power equipment and power cabling for the information system from damage and destruction.

## Control Objective

This includes, for example, generators and power cabling outside of buildings, internal cabling and uninterruptable power sources within an office or data center, and power sources for self-contained entities such as vehicles and satellites.
