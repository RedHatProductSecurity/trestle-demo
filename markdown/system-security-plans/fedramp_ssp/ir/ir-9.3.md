# ir-9.3 - \[Incident Response\] Post-spill Operations

## Control Statement

The organization implements organization-defined procedures to ensure that organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-9(3)[1]\] defines procedures that ensure organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions; and

- \[IR-9(3)[2]\] implements organization-defined procedures to ensure that organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions.

## Control guidance

Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to information spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not have access to the contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct organizational business.
