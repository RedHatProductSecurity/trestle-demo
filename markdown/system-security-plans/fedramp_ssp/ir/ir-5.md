# ir-5 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Monitoring

## Control Statement

The organization tracks and documents information system security incidents.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example, maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports.
