# ir-4 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Handling

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

- \[b.\] Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

- \[c.\] Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-4(a)\] implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes:

  - \[IR-4(a)[1]\] preparation;
  - \[IR-4(a)[2]\] detection and analysis;
  - \[IR-4(a)[3]\] containment;
  - \[IR-4(a)[4]\] eradication;
  - \[IR-4(a)[5]\] recovery;

- \[IR-4(b)\] coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities;

- \[IR-4(c)\]

  - \[IR-4(c)[1]\] incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into:

    - \[IR-4(c)[1][a]\] incident response procedures;
    - \[IR-4(c)[1][b]\] training;
    - \[IR-4(c)[1][c]\] testing/exercises;

  - \[IR-4(c)[2]\] implements the resulting changes accordingly to:

    - \[IR-4(c)[2][a]\] incident response procedures;
    - \[IR-4(c)[2][b]\] training; and
    - \[IR-4(c)[2][c]\] testing/exercises.

## Control guidance

Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).
