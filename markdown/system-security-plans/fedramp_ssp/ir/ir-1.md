# ir-1 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Response Policy and Procedures

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops, documents, and disseminates to organization-defined personnel or roles:

  - \[1.\] An incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
  - \[2.\] Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and associated incident response controls; and

- \[b.\] Reviews and updates the current:

  - \[1.\] Incident response policy organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[2.\] Incident response procedures organization-defined frequency.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-1(a)\]

  - \[IR-1(a)(1)\]

    - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1]\] develops and documents an incident response policy that addresses:

      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][a]\] purpose;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][b]\] scope;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][c]\] roles;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][d]\] responsibilities;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][e]\] management commitment;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][f]\] coordination among organizational entities;
      - \[IR-1(a)(1)[1][g]\] compliance;

    - \[IR-1(a)(1)[2]\] defines personnel or roles to whom the incident response policy is to be disseminated;
    - \[IR-1(a)(1)[3]\] disseminates the incident response policy to organization-defined personnel or roles;

  - \[IR-1(a)(2)\]

    - \[IR-1(a)(2)[1]\] develops and documents procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and associated incident response controls;
    - \[IR-1(a)(2)[2]\] defines personnel or roles to whom the procedures are to be disseminated;
    - \[IR-1(a)(2)[3]\] disseminates the procedures to organization-defined personnel or roles;

- \[IR-1(b)\]

  - \[IR-1(b)(1)\]

    - \[IR-1(b)(1)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the current incident response policy;
    - \[IR-1(b)(1)[2]\] reviews and updates the current incident response policy with the organization-defined frequency;

  - \[IR-1(b)(2)\]

    - \[IR-1(b)(2)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the current incident response procedures; and
    - \[IR-1(b)(2)[2]\] reviews and updates the current incident response procedures with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.
