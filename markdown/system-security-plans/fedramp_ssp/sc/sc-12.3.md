# sc-12.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Asymmetric Keys

## Control Statement

The organization produces, controls, and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using [NSA-approved key management technology and processes; approved PKI Class 3 certificates or prepositioned keying material; approved PKI Class 3 or Class 4 certificates and hardware security tokens that protect the user’s private key].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization produces, controls, and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using one of the following:

- \[SC-12(3)[1]\] NSA-approved key management technology and processes;

- \[SC-12(3)[2]\] approved PKI Class 3 certificates or prepositioned keying material; or

- \[SC-12(3)[3]\] approved PKI Class 3 or Class 4 certificates and hardware security tokens that protect the user’s private key.
