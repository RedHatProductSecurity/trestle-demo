# sc-15 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Collaborative Computing Devices

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a.\] Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed; and

- \[b.\] Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-15(a)\]

  - \[SC-15(a)[1]\] the organization defines exceptions where remote activation of collaborative computing devices is to be allowed;
  - \[SC-15(a)[2]\] the information system prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices, except for organization-defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed; and

- \[SC-15(b)\] the information system provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

## Control guidance

Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated.
