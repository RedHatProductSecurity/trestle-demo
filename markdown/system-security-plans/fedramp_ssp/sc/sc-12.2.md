# sc-12.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Symmetric Keys

## Control Statement

The organization produces, controls, and distributes symmetric cryptographic keys using [NIST FIPS-compliant; NSA-approved] key management technology and processes.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization produces, controls, and distributes symmetric cryptographic keys using one of the following:

- \[SC-12(2)[1]\] NIST FIPS-compliant key management technology and processes; or

- \[SC-12(2)[2]\] NSA-approved key management technology and processes.
