# sc-7.4 - \[System and Communications Protection\] External Telecommunications Services

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

- \[(b)\] Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

- \[(c)\] Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

- \[(d)\] Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need and duration of that need; and

- \[(e)\] Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy organization-defined frequency and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-7(4)(a)\] implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

- \[SC-7(4)(b)\] establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

- \[SC-7(4)(c)\] protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

- \[SC-7(4)(d)\] documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with:

  - \[SC-7(4)(d)[1]\] a supporting mission/business need;
  - \[SC-7(4)(d)[2]\] duration of that need;

- \[SC-7(4)(e)\]

  - \[SC-7(4)(e)[1]\] defines a frequency to review exceptions to traffic flow policy;
  - \[SC-7(4)(e)[2]\] reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[SC-7(4)(e)[3]\] removes traffic flow policy exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need
