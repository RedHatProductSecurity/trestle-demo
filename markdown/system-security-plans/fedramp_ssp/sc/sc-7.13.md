# sc-7.13 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Isolation of Security Tools / Mechanisms / Support Components

## Control Statement

The organization isolates organization-defined information security tools, mechanisms, and support components from other internal information system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-7(13)[1]\] defines information security tools, mechanisms, and support components to be isolated from other internal information system components; and

- \[SC-7(13)[2]\] isolates organization-defined information security tools, mechanisms, and support components from other internal information system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.

## Control guidance

Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, for example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of organizations.
