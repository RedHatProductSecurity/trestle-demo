# mp-7.1 - \[Media Protection\] Prohibit Use Without Owner

## Control Statement

The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner.

## Control guidance

Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., malicious code insertion).
