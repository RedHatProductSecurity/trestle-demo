# ma-6 - \[Maintenance\] Timely Maintenance

## Control Statement

The organization obtains maintenance support and/or spare parts for organization-defined information system components within organization-defined time period of failure.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MA-6[1]\] defines information system components for which maintenance support and/or spare parts are to be obtained;

- \[MA-6[2]\] defines the time period within which maintenance support and/or spare parts are to be obtained after a failure;

- \[MA-6[3]\]

  - \[MA-6[3][a]\] obtains maintenance support for organization-defined information system components within the organization-defined time period of failure; and/or
  - \[MA-6[3][b]\] obtains spare parts for organization-defined information system components within the organization-defined time period of failure.

## Control guidance

Organizations specify the information system components that result in increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation when the functionality provided by those components is not operational. Organizational actions to obtain maintenance support typically include having appropriate contracts in place.
