# cm-10.1 - \[Configuration Management\] Open Source Software

## Control Statement

The organization establishes the following restrictions on the use of open source software: [organization-defined restrictions].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-10(1)[1]\] defines restrictions on the use of open source software; and

- \[CM-10(1)[2]\] establishes organization-defined restrictions on the use of open source software.

## Control guidance

Open source software refers to software that is available in source code form. Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided under software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there are also various licensing issues associated with open source software including, for example, the constraints on derivative use of such software.
