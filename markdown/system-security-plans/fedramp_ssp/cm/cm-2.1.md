# cm-2.1 - \[Configuration Management\] Reviews and Updates

## Control Statement

The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system:

- \[(a)\] organization-defined frequency;

- \[(b)\] When required due to Assignment organization-defined circumstances; and

- \[(c)\] As an integral part of information system component installations and upgrades.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-2(1)(a)\]

  - \[CM-2(1)(a)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the baseline configuration of the information system;
  - \[CM-2(1)(a)[2]\] reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system with the organization-defined frequency;

- \[CM-2(1)(b)\]

  - \[CM-2(1)(b)[1]\] defines circumstances that require the baseline configuration of the information system to be reviewed and updated;
  - \[CM-2(1)(b)[2]\] reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system when required due to organization-defined circumstances; and

- \[CM-2(1)(c)\] reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system as an integral part of information system component installations and upgrades.
