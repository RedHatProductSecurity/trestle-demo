# cm-6.1 - \[Configuration Management\] Automated Central Management / Application / Verification

## Control Statement

The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for organization-defined information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-6(1)[1]\] defines information system components for which automated mechanisms are to be employed to:

  - \[CM-6(1)[1][a]\] centrally manage configuration settings of such components;
  - \[CM-6(1)[1][b]\] apply configuration settings of such components;
  - \[CM-6(1)[1][c]\] verify configuration settings of such components;

- \[CM-6(1)[2]\] employs automated mechanisms to:

  - \[CM-6(1)[2][a]\] centrally manage configuration settings for organization-defined information system components;
  - \[CM-6(1)[2][b]\] apply configuration settings for organization-defined information system components; and
  - \[CM-6(1)[2][c]\] verify configuration settings for organization-defined information system components.
