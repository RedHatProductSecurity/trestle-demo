# cm-2.3 - \[Configuration Management\] Retention of Previous Configurations

## Control Statement

The organization retains [organization-defined previous versions of baseline configurations of the information system] to support rollback.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-2(3)[1]\] defines previous versions of baseline configurations of the information system to be retained to support rollback; and

- \[CM-2(3)[2]\] retains organization-defined previous versions of baseline configurations of the information system to support rollback.

## Control guidance

Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback may include, for example, hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, and configuration records.
