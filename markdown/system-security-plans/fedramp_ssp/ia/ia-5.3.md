# ia-5.3 - \[Identification and Authentication\] In-person or Trusted Third-party Registration

## Control Statement

The organization requires that the registration process to receive organization-defined types of and/or specific authenticators be conducted in person; by a trusted third party before organization-defined registration authority with authorization by organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control Objective

- \[IA-5(3)[1]\] defines types of and/or specific authenticators to be received in person or by a trusted third party;

- \[IA-5(3)[2]\] defines the registration authority with oversight of the registration process for receipt of organization-defined types of and/or specific authenticators;

- \[IA-5(3)[3]\] defines personnel or roles responsible for authorizing organization-defined registration authority;

- \[IA-5(3)[4]\] defines if the registration process is to be conducted:

  - \[IA-5(3)[4][a]\] in person; or
  - \[IA-5(3)[4][b]\] by a trusted third party; and

- \[IA-5(3)[5]\] requires that the registration process to receive organization-defined types of and/or specific authenticators be conducted in person or by a trusted third party before organization-defined registration authority with authorization by organization-defined personnel or roles.
