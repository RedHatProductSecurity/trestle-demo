# ia-8.3 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Use of Ficam-approved Products

## Control Statement

The organization employs only FICAM-approved information system components in organization-defined information systems to accept third-party credentials.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-8(3)[1]\] defines information systems in which only FICAM-approved information system components are to be employed to accept third-party credentials; and

- \[IA-8(3)[2]\] employs only FICAM-approved information system components in organization-defined information systems to accept third-party credentials.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement typically applies to information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. FICAM-approved information system components include, for example, information technology products and software libraries that have been approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management conformance program.
