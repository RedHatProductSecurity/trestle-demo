# cm-11 - \[Configuration Management\] User-installed Software

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Establishes {{ insert: param, cm-11_prm_1 }} governing the installation of software by users;

- \[b.\] Enforces software installation policies through {{ insert: param, cm-11_prm_2 }}; and

- \[c.\] Monitors policy compliance at {{ insert: param, cm-11_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-11(a)\]

  - \[CM-11(a)[1]\] defines policies to govern the installation of software by users;
  - \[CM-11(a)[2]\] establishes organization-defined policies governing the installation of software by users;

- \[CM-11(b)\]

  - \[CM-11(b)[1]\] defines methods to enforce software installation policies;
  - \[CM-11(b)[2]\] enforces software installation policies through organization-defined methods;

- \[CM-11(c)\]

  - \[CM-11(c)[1]\] defines frequency to monitor policy compliance; and
  - \[CM-11(c)[2]\] monitors policy compliance at organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

If provided the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install software in organizational information systems. To maintain control over the types of software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations may include, for example, updates and security patches to existing software and downloading applications from organization-approved “app stores” Prohibited software installations may include, for example, software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies organizations select governing user-installed software may be organization-developed or provided by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods (e.g., periodic examination of user accounts), automated methods (e.g., configuration settings implemented on organizational information systems), or both.

<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
