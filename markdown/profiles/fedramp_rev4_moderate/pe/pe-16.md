# pe-16 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Delivery and Removal

## Control Statement

The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls {{ insert: param, pe-16_prm_1 }} entering and exiting the facility and maintains records of those items.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-16[1]\] defines types of information system components to be authorized, monitored, and controlled as such components are entering and exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16[2]\] authorizes organization-defined information system components entering the facility;

- \[PE-16[3]\] monitors organization-defined information system components entering the facility;

- \[PE-16[4]\] controls organization-defined information system components entering the facility;

- \[PE-16[5]\] authorizes organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16[6]\] monitors organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16[7]\] controls organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16[8]\] maintains records of information system components entering the facility; and

- \[PE-16[9]\] maintains records of information system components exiting the facility.

## Control guidance

Effectively enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of information system components may require restricting access to delivery areas and possibly isolating the areas from the information system and media libraries.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
