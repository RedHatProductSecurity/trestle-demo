# pe-13.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Suppression Devices / Systems

## Control Statement

The organization employs fire suppression devices/systems for the information system that provide automatic notification of any activation to {{ insert: param, pe-13.2_prm_1 }} and {{ insert: param, pe-13.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-13(2)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be provided automatic notification of any activation of fire suppression devices/systems for the information system;

- \[PE-13(2)[2]\] defines emergency responders to be provided automatic notification of any activation of fire suppression devices/systems for the information system;

- \[PE-13(2)[3]\] employs fire suppression devices/systems for the information system that provide automatic notification of any activation to:

  - \[PE-13(2)[3][a]\] organization-defined personnel or roles; and
  - \[PE-13(2)[3][b]\] organization-defined emergency responders.

## Control guidance

Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders in the event that individuals on the notification list must have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances, for example, to obtain access to facilities where classified operations are taking place or where there are information systems containing classified information.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
