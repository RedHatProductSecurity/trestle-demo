# pe-10 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Emergency Shutoff

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or individual system components in emergency situations;

- \[b.\] Places emergency shutoff switches or devices in {{ insert: param, pe-10_prm_1 }} to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

- \[c.\] Protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-10(a)\] provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or individual system components in emergency situations;

- \[PE-10(b)\]

  - \[PE-10(b)[1]\] defines the location of emergency shutoff switches or devices by information system or system component;
  - \[PE-10(b)[2]\] places emergency shutoff switches or devices in the organization-defined location by information system or system component to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

- \[PE-10(c)\] protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources including, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
