# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Temperature and Humidity Controls

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b.\] Monitors temperature and humidity levels {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-14(a)\]

  - \[PE-14(a)[1]\] defines acceptable temperature levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-14(a)[2]\] defines acceptable humidity levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[PE-14(a)[3]\] maintains temperature levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;
  - \[PE-14(a)[4]\] maintains humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;

- \[PE-14(b)\]

  - \[PE-14(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to monitor temperature levels;
  - \[PE-14(b)[2]\] defines the frequency to monitor humidity levels;
  - \[PE-14(b)[3]\] monitors temperature levels with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[PE-14(b)[4]\] monitors humidity levels with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

## Control item

### item

The service provider measures temperature at server inlets and humidity levels by dew point.
