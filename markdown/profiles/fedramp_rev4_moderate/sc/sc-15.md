# sc-15 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Collaborative Computing Devices

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a.\] Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: {{ insert: param, sc-15_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b.\] Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-15(a)\]

  - \[SC-15(a)[1]\] the organization defines exceptions where remote activation of collaborative computing devices is to be allowed;
  - \[SC-15(a)[2]\] the information system prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices, except for organization-defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed; and

- \[SC-15(b)\] the information system provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

## Control guidance

Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

## Control item

### item

The information system provides disablement (instead of physical disconnect) of collaborative computing devices in a manner that supports ease of use.
