# sc-12.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Asymmetric Keys

## Control Statement

The organization produces, controls, and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using {{ insert: param, sc-12.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization produces, controls, and distributes asymmetric cryptographic keys using one of the following:

- \[SC-12(3)[1]\] NSA-approved key management technology and processes;

- \[SC-12(3)[2]\] approved PKI Class 3 certificates or prepositioned keying material; or

- \[SC-12(3)[3]\] approved PKI Class 3 or Class 4 certificates and hardware security tokens that protect the userâ€™s private key.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
