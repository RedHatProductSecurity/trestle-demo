# sc-21 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Secure Name / Address Resolution Service (recursive or Caching Resolver)

## Control Statement

The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system:

- \[SC-21[1]\] requests data origin authentication on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources;

- \[SC-21[2]\] requests data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources;

- \[SC-21[3]\] performs data origin authentication on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources; and

- \[SC-21[4]\] performs data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

## Control guidance

Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own, or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
