# ac-19.5 - \[Access Control\] Full Device / Container-based Encryption

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, ac-19.5_prm_1 }} to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on {{ insert: param, ac-19.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-19(5)[1]\] defines mobile devices for which full-device encryption or container encryption is required to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on such devices; and

- \[AC-19(5)[2]\] employs full-device encryption or container encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on organization-defined mobile devices.

## Control guidance

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including for example, encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
