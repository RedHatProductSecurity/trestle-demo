# au-12 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Generation

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a.\] Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at {{ insert: param, au-12_prm_1 }};

- \[b.\] Allows {{ insert: param, au-12_prm_2 }} to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and

- \[c.\] Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-12(a)\]

  - \[AU-12(a)[1]\] the organization defines the information system components which are to provide audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2a;
  - \[AU-12(a)[2]\] the information system provides audit record generation capability, for the auditable events defined in AU-2a, at organization-defined information system components;

- \[AU-12(b)\]

  - \[AU-12(b)[1]\] the organization defines the personnel or roles allowed to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system;
  - \[AU-12(b)[2]\] the information system allows the organization-defined personnel or roles to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the system; and

- \[AU-12(c)\] the information system generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2d with the content in defined in AU-3.

## Control guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different information system components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit records.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
