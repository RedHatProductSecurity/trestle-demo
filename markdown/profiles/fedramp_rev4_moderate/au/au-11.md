# au-11 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Record Retention

## Control Statement

The organization retains audit records for {{ insert: param, au-11_prm_1 }} to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-11[1]\] defines a time period to retain audit records that is consistent with records retention policy;

- \[AU-11[2]\] retains audit records for the organization-defined time period consistent with records retention policy to:

  - \[AU-11[2][a]\] provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
  - \[AU-11[2][b]\] meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

## Control guidance

Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules provide federal policy on record retention.
