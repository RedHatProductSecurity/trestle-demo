# si-11 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Error Handling

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a.\] Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries; and

- \[b.\] Reveals error messages only to {{ insert: param, si-11_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SI-11(a)\] the information system generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries;

- \[SI-11(b)\]

  - \[SI-11(b)[1]\] the organization defines personnel or roles to whom error messages are to be revealed; and
  - \[SI-11(b)[2]\] the information system reveals error messages only to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
