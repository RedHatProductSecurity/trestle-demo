# ir-4.8 - \[Incident Response\] Correlation with External Organizations

## Control Statement

The organization coordinates with {{ insert: param, ir-4.8_prm_1 }} to correlate and share {{ insert: param, ir-4.8_prm_2 }} to achieve a cross-organization perspective on incident awareness and more effective incident responses.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-4(8)[1]\] defines external organizations with whom organizational incident information is to be coordinated;

- \[IR-4(8)[2]\] defines incident information to be correlated and shared with organization-defined external organizations; and

- \[IR-4(8)[3]\] the organization coordinates with organization-defined external organizations to correlate and share organization-defined information to achieve a cross-organization perspective on incident awareness and more effective incident responses.

## Control guidance

The coordination of incident information with external organizations including, for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition partners, customers, and multitiered developers, can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination with respect to incident handling can serve as an important risk management capability. This capability allows organizations to leverage critical information from a variety of sources to effectively respond to information security-related incidents potentially affecting the organizationâ€™s operations, assets, and individuals.

<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
