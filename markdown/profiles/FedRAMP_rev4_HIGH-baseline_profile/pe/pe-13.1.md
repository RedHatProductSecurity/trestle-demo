# pe-13.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Detection Devices / Systems

## Control Statement

The organization employs fire detection devices/systems for the information system that activate automatically and notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.1_prm_1 }} and {{ insert: param, pe-13.1_prm_2 }} in the event of a fire.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-13(1)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be notified in the event of a fire;

- \[PE-13(1)[2]\] defines emergency responders to be notified in the event of a fire;

- \[PE-13(1)[3]\] employs fire detection devices/systems for the information system that, in the event of a fire,:

  - \[PE-13(1)[3][a]\] activate automatically;
  - \[PE-13(1)[3][b]\] notify organization-defined personnel or roles; and
  - \[PE-13(1)[3][c]\] notify organization-defined emergency responders.

## Control guidance

Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders in the event that individuals on the notification list must have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances, for example, to obtain access to facilities where classified operations are taking place or where there are information systems containing classified information.
