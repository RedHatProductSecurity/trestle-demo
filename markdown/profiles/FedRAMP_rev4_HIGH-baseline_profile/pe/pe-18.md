# pe-18 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Location of Information System Components

## Control Statement

The organization positions information system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_prm_1 }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-18[1]\] defines physical hazards that could result in potential damage to information system components within the facility;

- \[PE-18[2]\] defines environmental hazards that could result in potential damage to information system components within the facility;

- \[PE-18[3]\] positions information system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from organization-defined physical and environmental hazards; and

- \[PE-18[4]\] positions information system components within the facility to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control guidance

Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. In addition, organizations consider the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be in close proximity to information systems and therefore increase the potential for unauthorized access to organizational communications (e.g., through the use of wireless sniffers or microphones).

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
