# sa-17 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer Security Architecture and Design

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

- \[a.\] Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;

- \[b.\] Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and

- \[c.\] Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

- \[SA-17(a)\] is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;

- \[SA-17(b)\] accurately and completely describes:

  - \[SA-17(b)[1]\] the required security functionality;
  - \[SA-17(b)[2]\] the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and

- \[SA-17(c)\] expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## Control guidance

This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.

<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
