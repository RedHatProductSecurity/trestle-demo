# ia-2.10 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Single Sign-on

## Control Statement

Provide a single sign-on capability for {{ insert: param, ia-2.10_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by single sign-on capabilities with the risk introduced by allowing access to multiple systems via a single authentication event. Single sign-on can present opportunities to improve system security, for example by providing the ability to add multi-factor authentication for applications and systems (existing and new) that may not be able to natively support multi-factor authentication.
