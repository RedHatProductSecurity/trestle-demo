# ia-12.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] In-person Validation and Verification

## Control Statement

Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person before a designated registration authority.

## Control guidance

In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals, the presentation of physical identity documents, and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities.
