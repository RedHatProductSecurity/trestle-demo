# ia-5.7 - \[Identification and Authentication\] No Embedded Unencrypted Static Authenticators

## Control Statement

Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

## Control guidance

In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.
