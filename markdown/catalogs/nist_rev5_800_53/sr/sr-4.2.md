# sr-4.2 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Track and Trace

## Control Statement

Establish and maintain unique identification of the following systems and critical system components for tracking through the supply chain: {{ insert: param, sr-4.2_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Tracking the unique identification of systems and system components during development and transport activities provides a foundational identity structure for the establishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, system components may be labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. Labels and tags can help provide better visibility into the provenance of a system or system component. A system or system component may have more than one unique identifier. Identification methods are sufficient to support a forensic investigation after a supply chain compromise or event.
