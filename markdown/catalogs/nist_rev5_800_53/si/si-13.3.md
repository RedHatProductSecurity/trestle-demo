# si-13.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Manual Transfer Between Components

## Control Statement

Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches {{ insert: param, si-13.3_prm_1 }} of the mean time to failure.

## Control guidance

For example, if the MTTF for a system component is 100 days and the MTTF percentage defined by the organization is 90 percent, the manual transfer would occur after 90 days.
