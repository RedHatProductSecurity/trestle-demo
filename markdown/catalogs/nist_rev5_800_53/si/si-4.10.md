# si-4.10 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Visibility of Encrypted Communications

## Control Statement

Make provisions so that {{ insert: param, si-4.10_prm_1 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-4.10_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.
