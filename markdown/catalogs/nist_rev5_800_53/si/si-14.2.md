# si-14.2 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Non-persistent Information

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] {{ insert: param, si-14.2_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Delete information when no longer needed.

## Control guidance

Retaining information longer than is needed makes the information a potential target for advanced adversaries searching for high value assets to compromise through unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, or exfiltration. For system-related information, unnecessary retention provides advanced adversaries information that can assist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through the system.
