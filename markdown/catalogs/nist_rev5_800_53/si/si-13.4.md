# si-13.4 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Standby Component Installation and Notification

## Control Statement

If system component failures are detected:

- \[(a)\] Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within {{ insert: param, si-13.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] {{ insert: param, si-13.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.
