# si-4.22 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Unauthorized Network Services

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Detect network services that have not been authorized or approved by {{ insert: param, si-4.22_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] {{ insert: param, si-4.22_prm_2 }} when detected.

## Control guidance

Unauthorized or unapproved network services include services in service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or validation and may therefore be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for valid services.
