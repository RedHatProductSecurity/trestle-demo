# au-9.6 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Read-only Access

## Control Statement

Authorize read-only access to audit information to {{ insert: param, au-9.6_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Restricting privileged user or role authorizations to read-only helps to limit the potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users or roles, such as deleting audit records to cover up malicious activity.
