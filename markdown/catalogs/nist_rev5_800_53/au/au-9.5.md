# au-9.5 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Dual Authorization

## Control Statement

Enforce dual authorization for {{ insert: param, au-9.5_prm_1 }} of {{ insert: param, au-9.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms (also known as two-person control) require the approval of two authorized individuals to execute audit functions. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety.
