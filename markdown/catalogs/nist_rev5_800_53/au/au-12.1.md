# au-12.1 - \[Audit and Accountability\] System-wide and Time-correlated Audit Trail

## Control Statement

Compile audit records from {{ insert: param, au-12.1_prm_1 }} into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within {{ insert: param, au-12.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
