# au-6.7 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Permitted Actions

## Control Statement

Specify the permitted actions for each {{ insert: param, au-6.7_prm_1 }} associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit record information.

## Control guidance

Organizations specify permitted actions for system processes, roles, and users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through system account management activities. Specifying permitted actions on audit record information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the system and include read, write, execute, append, and delete.
