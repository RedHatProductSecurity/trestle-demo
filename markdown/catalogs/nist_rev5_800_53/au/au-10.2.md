# au-10.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Validate Binding of Information Producer Identity

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information at {{ insert: param, au-10.2_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Perform {{ insert: param, au-10.2_prm_2 }} in the event of a validation error.

## Control guidance

Validating the binding of the information producer identity to the information prevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved by, for example, using cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.
