# au-5.5 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Alternate Audit Logging Capability

## Control Statement

Provide an alternate audit logging capability in the event of a failure in primary audit logging capability that implements {{ insert: param, au-5.5_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Since an alternate audit logging capability may be a short-term protection solution employed until the failure in the primary audit logging capability is corrected, organizations may determine that the alternate audit logging capability need only provide a subset of the primary audit logging functionality that is impacted by the failure.
