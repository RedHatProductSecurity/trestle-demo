# au-9.7 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Store on Component with Different Operating System

## Control Statement

Store audit information on a component running a different operating system than the system or component being audited.

## Control guidance

Storing auditing information on a system component running a different operating system reduces the risk of a vulnerability specific to the system, resulting in a compromise of the audit records.
