# au-6.9 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Correlation with Information from Nontechnical Sources

## Control Statement

Correlate information from nontechnical sources with audit record information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

## Control guidance

Nontechnical sources include records that document organizational policy violations related to harassment incidents and the improper use of information assets. Such information can lead to a directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Organizations limit access to information that is available from nontechnical sources due to its sensitive nature. Limited access minimizes the potential for inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals who do not have a need to know. The correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit record information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in an incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating such actions.
