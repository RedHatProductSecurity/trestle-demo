# ac-6.4 - \[Access Control\] Separate Processing Domains

## Control Statement

Provide separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.

## Control guidance

Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges includes using virtualization techniques to permit additional user privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying physical machine, implementing separate physical domains, and employing hardware or software domain separation mechanisms.
