# ac-2.2 - \[Access Control\] Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management

## Control Statement

Automatically {{ insert: param, ac-2.2_prm_1 }} temporary and emergency accounts after {{ insert: param, ac-2.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.
