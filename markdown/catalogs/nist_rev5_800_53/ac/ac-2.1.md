# ac-2.1 - \[Access Control\] Automated System Account Management

## Control Statement

Support the management of system accounts using {{ insert: param, ac-2.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.
