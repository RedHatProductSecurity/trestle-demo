# ac-4.7 - \[Access Control\] One-way Flow Mechanisms

## Control Statement

Enforce one-way information flows through hardware-based flow control mechanisms.

## Control guidance

One-way flow mechanisms may also be referred to as a unidirectional network, unidirectional security gateway, or data diode. One-way flow mechanisms can be used to prevent data from being exported from a higher impact or classified domain or system while permitting data from a lower impact or unclassified domain or system to be imported.
