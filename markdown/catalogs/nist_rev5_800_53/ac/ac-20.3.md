# ac-20.3 - \[Access Control\] Non-organizationally Owned Systems â€” Restricted Use

## Control Statement

Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information using {{ insert: param, ac-20.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or system components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned devices. There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use (see [AC-20 b.](#ac-20_smt.b)). In other cases, the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.
