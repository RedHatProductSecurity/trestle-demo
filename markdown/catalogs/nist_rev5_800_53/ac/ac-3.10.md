# ac-3.10 - \[Access Control\] Audited Override of Access Control Mechanisms

## Control Statement

Employ an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under {{ insert: param, ac-3.10_prm_1 }} by {{ insert: param, ac-3.10_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

In certain situations, such as when there is a threat to human life or an event that threatens the organizationâ€™s ability to carry out critical missions or business functions, an override capability for access control mechanisms may be needed. Override conditions are defined by organizations and used only in those limited circumstances. Audit events are defined in [AU-2](#au-2). Audit records are generated in [AU-12](#au-12).
