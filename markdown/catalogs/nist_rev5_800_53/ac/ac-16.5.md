# ac-16.5 - \[Access Control\] Attribute Displays on Objects to Be Output

## Control Statement

Display security and privacy attributes in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify {{ insert: param, ac-16.5_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, ac-16.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

System outputs include printed pages, screens, or equivalent items. System output devices include printers, notebook computers, video displays, smart phones, and tablets. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized exposure of information (e.g., shoulder surfing), the outputs display full attribute values when unmasked by the subscriber.
