# ac-17.3 - \[Access Control\] Managed Access Control Points

## Control Statement

Route remote accesses through authorized and managed network access control points.

## Control guidance

Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative [DHS TIC](#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54) requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of access control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces.
