# ac-17.1 - \[Access Control\] Monitoring and Control

## Control Statement

Employ automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.

## Control guidance

Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers, notebook computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Audit logging for remote access is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2). Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).
