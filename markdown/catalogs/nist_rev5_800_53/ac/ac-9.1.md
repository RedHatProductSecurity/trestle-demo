# ac-9.1 - \[Access Control\] Unsuccessful Logons

## Control Statement

Notify the user, upon successful logon, of the number of unsuccessful logon attempts since the last successful logon.

## Control guidance

Information about the number of unsuccessful logon attempts since the last successful logon allows the user to recognize if the number of unsuccessful logon attempts is consistent with the userâ€™s actual logon attempts.
