# pe-11.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Alternate Power Supply â€” Self-contained

## Control Statement

Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.2_prm_1 }} and that is:

- \[(a)\] Self-contained;

- \[(b)\] Not reliant on external power generation; and

- \[(c)\] Capable of maintaining {{ insert: param, pe-11.2_prm_2 }} in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control guidance

The provision of a long-term, self-contained power supply can be satisfied by using one or more generators with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the organization.
