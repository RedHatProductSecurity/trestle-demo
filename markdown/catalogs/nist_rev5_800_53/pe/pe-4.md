## Control guidance

Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering.

Security controls used to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and wiretapping sensors.
