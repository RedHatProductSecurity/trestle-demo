## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Enforce access restrictions using {{ insert: param, cm-5.1_prm_1 }}; and

## Control guidance

Organizations log system accesses associated with applying configuration changes to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes.
