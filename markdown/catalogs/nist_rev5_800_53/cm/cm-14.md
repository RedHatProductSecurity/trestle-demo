# cm-14 - \[Configuration Management\] Signed Components

## Control Statement

Prevent the installation of {{ insert: param, cm-14_prm_1 }} without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

## Control guidance

Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input/output system updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a method of code authentication.
