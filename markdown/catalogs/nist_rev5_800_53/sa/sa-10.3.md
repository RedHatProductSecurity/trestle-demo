# sa-10.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Hardware Integrity Verification

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

## Control guidance

Hardware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware components using developer-provided tools, techniques, methods, and mechanisms. Organizations may verify the integrity of hardware components with hard-to-copy labels, verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and by requiring the use of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components also include hardware and firmware updates to such components.
