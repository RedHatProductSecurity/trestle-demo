# sa-23 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Specialization

## Control Statement

Employ {{ insert: param, sa-23_prm_1 }} on {{ insert: param, sa-23_prm_2 }} supporting mission essential services or functions to increase the trustworthiness in those systems or components.

## Control guidance

It is often necessary for a system or system component that supports mission-essential services or functions to be enhanced to maximize the trustworthiness of the resource. Sometimes this enhancement is done at the design level. In other instances, it is done post-design, either through modifications of the system in question or by augmenting the system with additional components. For example, supplemental authentication or non-repudiation functions may be added to the system to enhance the identity of critical resources to other resources that depend on the organization-defined resources.
