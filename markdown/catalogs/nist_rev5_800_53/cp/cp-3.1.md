# cp-3.1 - \[Contingency Planning\] Simulated Events

## Control Statement

Incorporate simulated events into contingency training to facilitate effective response by personnel in crisis situations.

## Control guidance

The use of simulated events creates an environment for personnel to experience actual threat events, including cyber-attacks that disable websites, ransomware attacks that encrypt organizational data on servers, hurricanes that damage or destroy organizational facilities, or hardware or software failures.
