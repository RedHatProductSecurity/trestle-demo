# sc-32 - \[System and Communications Protection\] System Partitioning

## Control Statement

Partition the system into {{ insert: param, sc-32_prm_1 }} residing in separate {{ insert: param, sc-32_prm_2 }} domains or environments based on {{ insert: param, sc-32_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

System partitioning is part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components. Physical separation options include physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, critical components in separate rooms, and geographical separation of critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned system components.
