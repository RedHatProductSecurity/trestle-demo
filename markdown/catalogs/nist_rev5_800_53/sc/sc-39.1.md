# sc-39.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware Separation

## Control Statement

Implement hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process isolation.

## Control guidance

Hardware-based separation of system processes is generally less susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the separation will be enforced. Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware memory management.
