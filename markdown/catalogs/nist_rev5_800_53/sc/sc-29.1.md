# sc-29.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Virtualization Techniques

## Control Statement

Employ virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of operating systems and applications that are changed {{ insert: param, sc-29.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

While frequent changes to operating systems and applications can pose significant configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for adversaries to conduct successful attacks. Changing virtual operating systems or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems or applications, provides virtual changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. Virtualization techniques can assist in isolating untrustworthy software or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.
