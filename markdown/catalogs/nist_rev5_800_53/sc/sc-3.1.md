# sc-3.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware Separation

Employ hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.

## Control guidance

Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware ring architectures that are implemented within microprocessors and hardware-enforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate attributes (i.e., readable, writeable).
