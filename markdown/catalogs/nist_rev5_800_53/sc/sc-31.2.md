# sc-31.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Maximum Bandwidth

## Control Statement

Reduce the maximum bandwidth for identified covert {{ insert: param, sc-31.2_prm_1 }} channels to {{ insert: param, sc-31.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

The complete elimination of covert channels, especially covert timing channels, is usually not possible without significant performance impacts.
