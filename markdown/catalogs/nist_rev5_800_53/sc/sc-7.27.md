# sc-7.27 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Unclassified Non-national Security System Connections

## Control Statement

Prohibit the direct connection of {{ insert: param, sc-7.27_prm_1 }} to an external network without the use of {{ insert: param, sc-7.27_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

A direct connection is a dedicated physical or virtual connection between two or more systems. Organizations typically do not have complete control over external networks, including the Internet. Boundary protection devices (e.g., firewalls, gateways, and routers) mediate communications and information flows between unclassified non-national security systems and external networks.
