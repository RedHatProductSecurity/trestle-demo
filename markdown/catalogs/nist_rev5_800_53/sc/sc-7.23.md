# sc-7.23 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Disable Sender Feedback on Protocol Validation Failure

## Control Statement

Disable feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.

## Control guidance

Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information that would otherwise be unavailable.
