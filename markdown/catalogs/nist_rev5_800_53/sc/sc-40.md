# sc-40 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Wireless Link Protection

## Control Statement

Protect external and internal {{ insert: param, sc-40_prm_1 }} from the following signal parameter attacks: {{ insert: param, sc-40_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Wireless link protection applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized system users. Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or spoof system users. Protection of wireless links reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement wireless link protections to the extent necessary to meet organizational security requirements.
