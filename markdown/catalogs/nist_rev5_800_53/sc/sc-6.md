# sc-6 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Resource Availability

## Control Statement

Protect the availability of resources by allocating {{ insert: param, sc-6_prm_1 }} by {{ insert: param, sc-6_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Priority protection prevents lower-priority processes from delaying or interfering with the system that services higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent users or processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources.
