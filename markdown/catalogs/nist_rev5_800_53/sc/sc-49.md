# sc-49 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware-enforced Separation and Policy Enforcement

## Control Statement

Implement hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between {{ insert: param, sc-49_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

System owners may require additional strength of mechanism and robustness to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation. Hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement provide greater strength of mechanism than software-enforced separation and policy enforcement.
