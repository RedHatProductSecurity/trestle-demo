# pt-3.1 - \[Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency\] Data Tagging

## Control Statement

Attach data tags containing the following purposes to {{ insert: param, pt-3.1_prm_1 }}: {{ insert: param, pt-3.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Data tags support the tracking of processing purposes by conveying the purposes along with the relevant elements of personally identifiable information throughout the system. By conveying the processing purposes in a data tag along with the personally identifiable information as the information transits a system, a system owner or operator can identify whether a change in processing would be compatible with the identified and documented purposes. Data tags may also support the use of automated tools.
