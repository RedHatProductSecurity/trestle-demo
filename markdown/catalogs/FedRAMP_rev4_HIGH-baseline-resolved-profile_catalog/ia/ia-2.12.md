# ia-2.12 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of PIV Credentials

## Control Statement

The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials.

- \[12_fr\]

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system:

- \[IA-2(12)[1]\] accepts Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials; and

- \[IA-2(12)[2]\] electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials.

## Control guidance

Include Common Access Card (CAC), i.e., the DoD technical implementation of PIV/FIPS 201/HSPD-12.
This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing logical access control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials.
