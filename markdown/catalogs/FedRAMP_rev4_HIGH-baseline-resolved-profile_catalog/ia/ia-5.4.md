# ia-5.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Automated Support for Password Strength Determination

## Control Statement

The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy {{ insert: param, ia-5.4_prm_1 }}.

- \[4_fr\]

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-5(4)[1]\] defines requirements to be satisfied by password authenticators; and

- \[IA-5(4)[2]\] employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy organization-defined requirements.

## Control guidance

If automated mechanisms which enforce password authenticator strength at creation are not used, automated mechanisms must be used to audit strength of created password authenticators.
This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords and the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of which is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1).
