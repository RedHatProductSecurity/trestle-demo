# ac-24.1 - \[Access Control\] Transmit Access Authorization Information

## Control Statement

The information system transmits {{ insert: param, ac-24.1_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, ac-24.1_prm_2 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-24.1_prm_3 }} that enforce access control decisions.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-24(1)[1]\] the organization defines access authorization information that the information system transmits to organization-defined information systems that enforce access control decisions;

- \[AC-24(1)[2]\] the organization defines security safeguards to be used when the information system transmits organization-defined authorization information to organization-defined information systems that enforce access control decisions;

- \[AC-24(1)[3]\] the organization defines the information systems that enforce access control decisions; and

- \[AC-24(1)[4]\] the information system transmits organization-defined access authorization information using organization-defined security safeguards to organization-defined information systems that enforce access control decisions.

## Control guidance

In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is due to the fact that in distributed information systems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made and different entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission.
