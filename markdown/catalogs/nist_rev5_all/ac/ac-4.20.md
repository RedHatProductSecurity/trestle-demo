# ac-4.20 - \[Access Control\] Approved Solutions

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, ac-4.20_prm_1 }} to control the flow of {{ insert: param, ac-4.20_prm_2 }} across security domains.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-4(20)[1]\] defines solutions in approved configurations to control the flow of information across security domains;

- \[AC-4(20)[2]\] defines information for which organization-defined solutions in approved configurations are to be employed to control the flow of such information across security domains; and

- \[AC-4(20)[3]\] employs organization-defined solutions in approved configurations to control the flow of organization-defined information across security domains.

## Control guidance

Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in cross-domain policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across classification boundaries. The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) provides a baseline listing of approved cross-domain solutions.
