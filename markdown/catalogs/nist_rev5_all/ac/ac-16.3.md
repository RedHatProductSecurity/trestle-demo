# ac-16.3 - \[Access Control\] Maintenance of Attribute Associations by Information System

## Control Statement

The information system maintains the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.3_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-16(3)[1]\] the organization defines security attributes to be associated with organization-defined subjects and objects;

- \[AC-16(3)[2]\] the organization defines subjects and objects requiring the association and integrity of security attributes to such subjects and objects to be maintained; and

- \[AC-16(3)[3]\] the information system maintains the association and integrity of organization-defined security attributes to organization-defined subjects and objects.

## Control guidance

Maintaining the association and integrity of security attributes to subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. Automated policy actions include, for example, access control decisions or information flow control decisions.
