# ac-16.1 - \[Access Control\] Dynamic Attribute Association

## Control Statement

Dynamically associate security and privacy attributes with {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_1 }} in accordance with the following security and privacy policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or privacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to information aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges), changes in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. Attributes may also change situationally.
