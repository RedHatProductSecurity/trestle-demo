# ac-16.1 - \[Access Control\] Dynamic Attribute Association

## Control Statement

The information system dynamically associates security attributes with {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_1 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_2 }} as information is created and combined.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-16(1)[1]\] the organization defines subjects and objects to which security attributes are to be dynamically associated as information is created and combined;

- \[AC-16(1)[2]\] the organization defines security policies requiring the information system to dynamically associate security attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects; and

- \[AC-16(1)[3]\] the information system dynamically associates security attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects in accordance with organization-defined security policies as information is created and combined.

## Control guidance

Dynamic association of security attributes is appropriate whenever the security characteristics of information changes over time. Security attributes may change, for example, due to information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual information elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges), and changes in the security category of information.
