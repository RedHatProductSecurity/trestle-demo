# ac-6.3 - \[Access Control\] Network Access to Privileged Commands

## Control Statement

The organization authorizes network access to {{ insert: param, ac-6.3_prm_1 }} only for {{ insert: param, ac-6.3_prm_2 }} and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-6(3)[1]\] defines privileged commands to which network access is to be authorized only for compelling operational needs;

- \[AC-6(3)[2]\] defines compelling operational needs for which network access to organization-defined privileged commands are to be solely authorized;

- \[AC-6(3)[3]\] authorizes network access to organization-defined privileged commands only for organization-defined compelling operational needs; and

- \[AC-6(3)[4]\] documents the rationale for authorized network access to organization-defined privileged commands in the security plan for the information system.

## Control guidance

Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device).
