# ac-2.7 - \[Access Control\] Role-based Schemes

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;

- \[(b)\] Monitors privileged role assignments; and

- \[(c)\] Takes {{ insert: param, ac-2.7_prm_1 }} when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-2(7)(a)\] establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;

- \[AC-2(7)(b)\] monitors privileged role assignments;

- \[AC-2(7)(c)\]

  - \[AC-2(7)(c)[1]\] defines actions to be taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate; and
  - \[AC-2(7)(c)[2]\] takes organization-defined actions when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Control guidance

Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management, account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web administration.
