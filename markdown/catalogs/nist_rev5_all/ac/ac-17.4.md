# ac-17.4 - \[Access Control\] Privileged Commands and Access

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.4_prm_1 }} ; and

## Control guidance

Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.
