# ac-4.7 - \[Access Control\] One-way Flow Mechanisms

## Control Statement

The information system enforces {{ insert: param, ac-4.7_prm_1 }} using hardware mechanisms.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-4(7)[1]\] the organization defines one-way information flows to be enforced by the information system; and

- \[AC-4(7)[2]\] the information system enforces organization-defined one-way information flows using hardware mechanisms.
