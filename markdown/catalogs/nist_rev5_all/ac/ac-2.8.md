# ac-2.8 - \[Access Control\] Dynamic Account Management

## Control Statement

Create, activate, manage, and deactivate {{ insert: param, ac-02.08_odp }} dynamically.

## Control guidance

Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating system accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for the dynamic management, creation, activation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing trust relationships, business rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges.

## Control assessment-objective
