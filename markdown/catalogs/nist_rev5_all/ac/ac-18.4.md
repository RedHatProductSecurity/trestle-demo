# ac-18.4 - \[Access Control\] Restrict Configurations by Users

## Control Statement

The organization identifies and explicitly authorizes users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-18(4)[1]\] identifies users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities; and

- \[AC-18(4)[2]\] explicitly authorizes the identified users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

## Control guidance

Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless networking capability are enforced in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms employed within organizational information systems.
