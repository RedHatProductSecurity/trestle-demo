# ac-4.9 - \[Access Control\] Human Reviews

## Control Statement

The information system enforces the use of human reviews for {{ insert: param, ac-4.9_prm_1 }} under the following conditions: {{ insert: param, ac-4.9_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-4(9)[1]\] the organization defines information flows requiring the use of human reviews;

- \[AC-4(9)[2]\] the organization defines conditions under which the use of human reviews for organization-defined information flows is to be enforced; and

- \[AC-4(9)[3]\] the information system enforces the use of human reviews for organization-defined information flows under organization-defined conditions.

## Control guidance

Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to, automated security policy filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed necessary by organizations.
