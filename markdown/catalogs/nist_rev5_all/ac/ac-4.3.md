# ac-4.3 - \[Access Control\] Dynamic Information Flow Control

## Control Statement

The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on {{ insert: param, ac-4.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-4(3)[1]\] the organization defines policies to enforce dynamic information flow control; and

- \[AC-4(3)[2]\] the information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on organization-defined policies.

## Control guidance

Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions or mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs, changes in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.
