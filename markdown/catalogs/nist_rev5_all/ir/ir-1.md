    - \[IR-1(a)(2)[3]\] disseminates the procedures to organization-defined personnel or roles;

- \[IR-1(b)\]

  - \[IR-1(b)(1)\]

    - \[IR-1(b)(1)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the current incident response policy;

## Control guidance

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.
