# ir-4.7 - \[Incident Response\] Insider Threats - Intra-organization Coordination

## Control Statement

The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across {{ insert: param, ir-4.7_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-4(7)[1]\] defines components or elements of the organization with whom the incident handling capability for insider threats is to be coordinated; and

- \[IR-4(7)[2]\] coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across organization-defined components or elements of the organization.

## Control guidance

Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination among a variety of organizational components or elements to be effective. These components or elements include, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations personnel, and risk executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external support from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.
