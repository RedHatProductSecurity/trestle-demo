# sc-17 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Public Key Infrastructure Certificates

## Control Statement

The organization issues public key certificates under an {{ insert: param, sc-17_prm_1 }} or obtains public key certificates from an approved service provider.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-17[1]\] defines a certificate policy for issuing public key certificates;

- \[SC-17[2]\] issues public key certificates:

  - \[SC-17[2][a]\] under an organization-defined certificate policy: or
  - \[SC-17[2][b]\] obtains public key certificates from an approved service provider.

## Control guidance

For all certificates, organizations manage information system trust stores to ensure only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores. This control addresses both certificates with visibility external to organizational information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, for example, application-specific time services.
