# sc-29 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Heterogeneity

## Control Statement

The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for {{ insert: param, sc-29_prm_1 }} in the implementation of the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-29[1]\] defines information system components requiring a diverse set of information technologies to be employed in the implementation of the information system; and

- \[SC-29[2]\] employs a diverse set of information technologies for organization-defined information system components in the implementation of the information system.

## Control guidance

Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also defends against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one information system component will be equally effective against other system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned cyber attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations.
