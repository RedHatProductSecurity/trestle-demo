# sc-23.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Unique System-generated Session Identifiers

## Control Statement

Generate a unique session identifier for each session with {{ insert: param, sc-23.03_odp }} and recognize only session identifiers that are system-generated.

## Control guidance

Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers.

## Control assessment-objective

a unique session identifier is generated for each session with {{ insert: param, sc-23.03_odp }};
only system-generated session identifiers are recognized.
