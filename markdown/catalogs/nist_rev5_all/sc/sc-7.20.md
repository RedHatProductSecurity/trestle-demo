# sc-7.20 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Dynamic Isolation / Segregation

## Control Statement

The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate {{ insert: param, sc-7.20_prm_1 }} from other components of the system.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-7(20)[1]\] the organization defines information system components to be dynamically isolated/segregated from other components of the system; and

- \[SC-7(20)[2]\] the information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate organization-defined information system components from other components of the system.

## Control guidance

The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information systems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the damage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur.
