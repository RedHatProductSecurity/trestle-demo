# sc-45.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Compare the internal system clocks {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.01 }} with {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.02 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.

## Control assessment-objective

the internal system clocks are compared {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.01 }} with {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.02 }};
the internal system clocks are synchronized with the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.03 }}.
