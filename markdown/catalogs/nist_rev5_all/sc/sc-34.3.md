# sc-34.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware-based Protection

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Employs hardware-based, write-protect for {{ insert: param, sc-34.3_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Implements specific procedures for {{ insert: param, sc-34.3_prm_2 }} to manually disable hardware write-protect for firmware modifications and re-enable the write-protect prior to returning to operational mode.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-34(3)(a)\]

  - \[SC-34(3)(a)[1]\] defines information system firmware components for which hardware-based, write-protection is to be employed;
  - \[SC-34(3)(a)[2]\] employs hardware-based, write-protection for organization-defined information system firmware components;

- \[SC-34(3)(b)\]

  - \[SC-34(3)(b)[1]\] defines individuals authorized to manually disable hardware write-protect for firmware modifications and re-enable the write-protect prior to returning to operational mode; and
  - \[SC-34(3)(b)[2]\] implements specific procedures for organization-defined authorized individuals to manually disable hardware write-protect for firmware modifications and re-enable the write-protect prior to returning to operational mode.
