# sc-2.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Interfaces for Non-privileged Users

## Control Statement

The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related functionality at an interface for non-privileged users.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related functionality at an interface for non-privileged users.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g., administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such restrictions include, for example, not presenting administration options until users establish sessions with administrator privileges.
