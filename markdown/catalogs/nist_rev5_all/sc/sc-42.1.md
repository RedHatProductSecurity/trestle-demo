## Control Statement

The organization ensures that the information system is configured so that data or information collected by the {{ insert: param, sc-42.1_prm_1 }} is only reported to authorized individuals or roles.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-42(1)[1]\] defines sensors to be used to collect data or information only reported to authorized individuals or roles; and

- \[SC-42(1)[2]\] ensures that the information system is configured so that data or information collected by the organization-defined sensors is only reported to authorized individuals or roles.

## Control guidance

In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals (e.g., end users), it is still possible that the data/information collected by the sensors will be sent to unauthorized entities.
