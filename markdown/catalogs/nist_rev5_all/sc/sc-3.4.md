# sc-3.4 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Module Coupling and Cohesiveness

## Control Statement

The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that:

- \[SC-3(4)[1]\] maximize internal cohesiveness within modules; and

- \[SC-3(4)[2]\] minimize coupling between modules.

## Control guidance

The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security functions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different functions within a particular module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.
