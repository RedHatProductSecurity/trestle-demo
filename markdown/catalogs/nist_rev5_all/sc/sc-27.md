# sc-27 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Platform-independent Applications

## Control Statement

The information system includes: {{ insert: param, sc-27_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-27[1]\] the organization defines platform-independent applications; and

- \[SC-27[2]\] the information system includes organization-defined platform-independent applications.

## Control guidance

Platforms are combinations of hardware and software used to run software applications. Platforms include: (i) operating systems; (ii) the underlying computer architectures, or (iii) both. Platform-independent applications are applications that run on multiple platforms. Such applications promote portability and reconstitution on different platforms, increasing the availability of critical functions within organizations while information systems with specific operating systems are under attack.
