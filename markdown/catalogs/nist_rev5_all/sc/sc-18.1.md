# sc-18.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Identify Unacceptable Code / Take Corrective Actions

## Control Statement

The information system identifies {{ insert: param, sc-18.1_prm_1 }} and takes {{ insert: param, sc-18.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-18(1)[1]\] the organization defines unacceptable mobile code to be identified by the information system;

- \[SC-18(1)[2]\] the organization defines correctives actions to be taken when the information system identifies organization-defined unacceptable mobile code;

- \[SC-18(1)[3]\] the information system:

  - \[SC-18(1)[3][a]\] identifies organization-defined unacceptable mobile code; and
  - \[SC-18(1)[3][b]\] takes organization-defined corrective actions.

## Control guidance

Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include, for example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes, for example, preventing transmission of word processing files with embedded macros when such macros have been defined to be unacceptable mobile code.
