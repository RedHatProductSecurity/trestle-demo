# sc-5.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Excess Capacity / Bandwidth / Redundancy

## Control Statement

The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system, to limit the effects of information flooding denial of service attacks, manages:

- \[SC-5(2)[1]\] excess capacity;

- \[SC-5(2)[2]\] bandwidth; or

- \[SC-5(2)[3]\] other redundancy.

## Control guidance

Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.
