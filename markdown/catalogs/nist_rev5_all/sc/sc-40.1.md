# sc-40.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Electromagnetic Interference

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms that achieve {{ insert: param, sc-40.1_prm_1 }} against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-40(1)[1]\] the organization defines level of protection to be employed against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference; and

- \[SC-40(1)[2]\] the information system employs cryptographic mechanisms that achieve organization-defined level of protection against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The control enhancement may also coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine levels of wireless link availability and performance/cryptography needed.
