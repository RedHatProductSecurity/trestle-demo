# sc-34.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] No Writable Storage

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sc-34.1_prm_1 }} with no writeable storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-34(1)[1]\] defines information system components to be employed with no writeable storage; and

- \[SC-34(1)[2]\] employs organization-defined information system components with no writeable storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement: (i) eliminates the possibility of malicious code insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated information system components; and (ii) applies to both fixed and removable storage, with the latter being addressed directly or as specific restrictions imposed through access controls for mobile devices.
