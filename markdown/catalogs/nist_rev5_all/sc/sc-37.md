# sc-37 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Out-of-band Channels

## Control Statement

Employ the following out-of-band channels for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of {{ insert: param, sc-37_odp.02 }} to {{ insert: param, sc-37_odp.03 }}: {{ insert: param, sc-37_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

Out-of-band channels include local, non-network accesses to systems; network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic; or non-electronic paths, such as the U.S. Postal Service. The use of out-of-band channels is contrasted with the use of in-band channels (i.e., the same channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability or exposure as in-band channels. Therefore, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise or adversely affect the out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of organizational items, including authenticators and credentials; cryptographic key management information; system and data backups; configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software; security updates; maintenance information; and malicious code protection updates.
