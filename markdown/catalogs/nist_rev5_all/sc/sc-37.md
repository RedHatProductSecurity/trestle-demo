# sc-37 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Out-of-band Channels

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sc-37_prm_1 }} for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of {{ insert: param, sc-37_prm_2 }} to {{ insert: param, sc-37_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-37[1]\] defines out-of-band channels to be employed for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of information, information system components, or devices to individuals or information systems;

- \[SC-37[2]\] defines information, information system components, or devices for which physical delivery or electronic transmission of such information, information system components, or devices to individuals or information systems requires employment of organization-defined out-of-band channels;

- \[SC-37[3]\] defines individuals or information systems to which physical delivery or electronic transmission of organization-defined information, information system components, or devices is to be achieved via employment of organization-defined out-of-band channels; and

- \[SC-37[4]\] employs organization-defined out-of-band channels for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of organization-defined information, information system components, or devices to organization-defined individuals or information systems.

## Control guidance

Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.
