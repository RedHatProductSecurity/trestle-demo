# sc-5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Denial of Service Protection

## Control Statement

The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of service attacks: {{ insert: param, sc-5_prm_1 }} by employing {{ insert: param, sc-5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-5[1]\] the organization defines types of denial of service attacks or reference to source of such information for the information system to protect against or limit the effects;

- \[SC-5[2]\] the organization defines security safeguards to be employed by the information system to protect against or limit the effects of organization-defined types of denial of service attacks; and

- \[SC-5[3]\] the information system protects against or limits the effects of the organization-defined denial or service attacks (or reference to source for such information) by employing organization-defined security safeguards.

## Control guidance

A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service attacks.
