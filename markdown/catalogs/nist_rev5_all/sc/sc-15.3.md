# sc-15.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Disabling / Removal in Secure Work Areas

## Control Statement

The organization disables or removes collaborative computing devices from {{ insert: param, sc-15.3_prm_1 }} in {{ insert: param, sc-15.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-15(3)[1]\] defines information systems or information system components from which collaborative computing devices are to be disabled or removed;

- \[SC-15(3)[2]\] defines secure work areas where collaborative computing devices are to be disabled or removed from information systems or information system components placed in such work areas; and

- \[SC-15(3)[3]\] disables or removes collaborative computing devices from organization-defined information systems or information system components in organization-defined secure work areas.

## Control guidance

Failing to disable or remove collaborative computing devices from information systems or information system components can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information including, for example, eavesdropping on conversations.
