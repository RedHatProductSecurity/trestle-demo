# sc-41 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Port and I/O Device Access

## Control Statement

The organization physically disables or removes {{ insert: param, sc-41_prm_1 }} on {{ insert: param, sc-41_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-41[1]\] defines connection ports or input/output devices to be physically disabled or removed on information systems or information system components;

- \[SC-41[2]\] defines information systems or information system components with organization-defined connection ports or input/output devices that are to be physically disabled or removed; and

- \[SC-41[3]\] physically disables or removes organization-defined connection ports or input/output devices on organization-defined information systems or information system components.

## Control guidance

Connection ports include, for example, Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Firewire (IEEE 1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include, for example, Compact Disk (CD) and Digital Video Disk (DVD) drives. Physically disabling or removing such connection ports and I/O devices helps prevent exfiltration of information from information systems and the introduction of malicious code into systems from those ports/devices.
