# sc-3.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware Separation

## Control Statement

The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.

## Control guidance

Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example, hardware ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardware-enforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate attributes (i.e., readable, writeable).
