# sc-39.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Hardware Separation

## Control Statement

The information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process separation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process separation.

## Control guidance

Hardware-based separation of information system processes is generally less susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the separation will be enforced. Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example, hardware memory management.
