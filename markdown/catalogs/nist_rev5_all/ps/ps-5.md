# ps-5 - \[Personnel Security\] Personnel Transfer

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Reviews and confirms ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access authorizations to information systems/facilities when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization;

- \[b.\] Initiates {{ insert: param, ps-5_prm_1 }} within {{ insert: param, ps-5_prm_2 }};

- \[c.\] Modifies access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in operational need due to reassignment or transfer; and

- \[d.\] Notifies {{ insert: param, ps-5_prm_3 }} within {{ insert: param, ps-5_prm_4 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-5(a)\] when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization, reviews and confirms ongoing operational need for current:

  - \[PS-5(a)[1]\] logical access authorizations to information systems;
  - \[PS-5(a)[2]\] physical access authorizations to information systems and facilities;

- \[PS-5(b)\]

  - \[PS-5(b)[1]\] defines transfer or reassignment actions to be initiated following transfer or reassignment;
  - \[PS-5(b)[2]\] defines the time period within which transfer or reassignment actions must occur following transfer or reassignment;
  - \[PS-5(b)[3]\] initiates organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions within the organization-defined time period following transfer or reassignment;

- \[PS-5(c)\] modifies access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in operational need due to reassignment or transfer;

- \[PS-5(d)\]

  - \[PS-5(d)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be notified when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization;
  - \[PS-5(d)[2]\] defines the time period within which to notify organization-defined personnel or roles when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization; and
  - \[PS-5(d)[3]\] notifies organization-defined personnel or roles within the organization-defined time period when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization.

## Control guidance

This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted. Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include, for example: (i) returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; (ii) closing information system accounts and establishing new accounts; (iii) changing information system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); and (iv) providing for access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in previous information system accounts.
