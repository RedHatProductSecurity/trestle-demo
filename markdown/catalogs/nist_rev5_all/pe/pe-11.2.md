# pe-11.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Long-term Alternate Power Supply - Self-contained

## Control Statement

The organization provides a long-term alternate power supply for the information system that is:

- \[(a)\] Self-contained;

- \[(b)\] Not reliant on external power generation; and

- \[(c)\] Capable of maintaining {{ insert: param, pe-11.2_prm_1 }} in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization provides a long-term alternate power supply for the information system that is:

- \[PE-11(2)(a)\] self-contained;

- \[PE-11(2)(b)\] not reliant on external power generation;

- \[PE-11(2)(c)\] capable of maintaining one of the following in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source:

  - \[PE-11(2)(c)[1]\] minimally required operational capability; or
  - \[PE-11(2)(c)[2]\] full operational capability.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement can be satisfied, for example, by the use of one or more generators with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the organization. Long-term alternate power supplies for organizational information systems are either manually or automatically activated.
