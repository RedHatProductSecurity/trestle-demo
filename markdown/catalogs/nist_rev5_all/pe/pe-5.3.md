# pe-5.3 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Marking Output Devices

## Control Statement

The organization marks {{ insert: param, pe-5.3_prm_1 }} indicating the appropriate security marking of the information permitted to be output from the device.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-5(3)[1]\] defines information system output devices to be marked with appropriate security marking of the information permitted to be output from such devices; and

- \[PE-5(3)[2]\] marks organization-defined information system output devices indicating the appropriate security marking of the information permitted to be output from the device.

## Control guidance

Outputs devices include, for example, printers, monitors, facsimile machines, scanners, copiers, and audio devices. This control enhancement is generally applicable to information system output devices other than mobiles devices.
