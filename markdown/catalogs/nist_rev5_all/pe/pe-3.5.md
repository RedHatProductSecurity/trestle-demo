# pe-3.5 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Tamper Protection

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, pe-3.5_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, pe-3.5_prm_2 }} physical tampering or alteration of {{ insert: param, pe-3.5_prm_3 }} within the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-3(5)[1]\] defines security safeguards to be employed to detect and/or prevent physical tampering or alteration of organization-defined hardware components within the information system;

- \[PE-3(5)[2]\] defines hardware components within the information system for which security safeguards are to be employed to detect and/or prevent physical tampering or alteration of such components;

- \[PE-3(5)[3]\] employs organization-defined security safeguards to do one or more of the following:

  - \[PE-3(5)[3][a]\] detect physical tampering or alteration of organization-defined hardware components within the information system; and/or
  - \[PE-3(5)[3][b]\] prevent physical tampering or alteration of organization-defined hardware components within the information system.

## Control guidance

Organizations may implement tamper detection/prevention at selected hardware components or tamper detection at some components and tamper prevention at other components. Tamper detection/prevention activities can employ many types of anti-tamper technologies including, for example, tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting and other supply chain-related risks.
