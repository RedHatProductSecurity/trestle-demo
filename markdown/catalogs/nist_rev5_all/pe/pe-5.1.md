Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-5(1)(a)\]

  - \[PE-5(1)(a)[1]\] defines output devices whose output requires physical access controls;
  - \[PE-5(1)(a)[2]\] controls physical access to output from organization-defined output devices; and

- \[PE-5(1)(b)\] ensures that only authorized individuals receive output from the device.
