# mp-6.3 - \[Media Protection\] Nondestructive Techniques

## Control Statement

The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the information system under the following circumstances: {{ insert: param, mp-6.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MP-6(3)[1]\] defines circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices; and

- \[MP-6(3)[2]\] applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the information system under organization-defined circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage devices can be the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources and may contain malicious code that can be readily transferred to information systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning such storage devices is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices are free of malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when organizations lose a positive chain of custody for the devices.
