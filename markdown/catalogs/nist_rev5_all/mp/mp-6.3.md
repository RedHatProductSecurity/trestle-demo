# mp-6.3 - \[Media Protection\] Nondestructive Techniques

## Control Statement

Apply nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the system under the following circumstances: {{ insert: param, mp-06.03_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Portable storage devices include external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), optical discs, magnetic or optical tapes, flash memory devices, flash memory cards, and other external or removable disks. Portable storage devices can be obtained from untrustworthy sources and contain malicious code that can be inserted into or transferred to organizational systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning storage devices is recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that such devices are free of malicious code. Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices when the devices are purchased from manufacturers or vendors prior to initial use or when organizations cannot maintain a positive chain of custody for the devices.
