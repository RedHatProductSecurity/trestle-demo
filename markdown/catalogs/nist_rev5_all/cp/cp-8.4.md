# cp-8.4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Provider Contingency Plan

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have contingency plans;

- \[(b)\] Reviews provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements; and

- \[(c)\] Obtains evidence of contingency testing/training by providers {{ insert: param, cp-8.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-8(4)(a)\]

  - \[CP-8(4)(a)[1]\] requires primary telecommunications service provider to have contingency plans;
  - \[CP-8(4)(a)[2]\] requires alternate telecommunications service provider(s) to have contingency plans;

- \[CP-8(4)(b)\] reviews provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational contingency requirements;

- \[CP-8(4)(c)\]

  - \[CP-8(4)(c)[1]\] defines the frequency to obtain evidence of contingency testing/training by providers; and
  - \[CP-8(4)(c)[2]\] obtains evidence of contingency testing/training by providers with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient evidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service providers may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, state, and local governments. Organizations may use these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.
