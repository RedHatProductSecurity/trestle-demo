# cp-11 - \[Contingency Planning\] Alternate Communications Protocols

## Control Statement

The information system provides the capability to employ {{ insert: param, cp-11_prm_1 }} in support of maintaining continuity of operations.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[CP-11[1]\] the organization defines alternative communications protocols to be employed in support of maintaining continuity of operations; and

- \[CP-11[2]\] the information system provides the capability to employ organization-defined alternative communications protocols in support of maintaining continuity of operations.

## Control guidance

Contingency plans and the associated training and testing for those plans, incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of increasing the resilience of organizational information systems. Alternate communications protocols include, for example, switching from Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 to TCP/IP Version 6. Switching communications protocols may affect software applications and therefore, the potential side effects of introducing alternate communications protocols are analyzed prior to implementation.
