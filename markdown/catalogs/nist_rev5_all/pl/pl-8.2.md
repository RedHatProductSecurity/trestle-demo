# pl-8.2 - \[Planning\] Supplier Diversity

## Control Statement

The organization requires that {{ insert: param, pl-8.2_prm_1 }} allocated to {{ insert: param, pl-8.2_prm_2 }} are obtained from different suppliers.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PL-8(2)[1]\] defines security safeguards to be allocated to locations and architectural layers within the design of its security architecture;

- \[PL-8(2)[2]\] defines locations and architectural layers of its security architecture in which organization-defined security safeguards are to be allocated; and

- \[PL-8(2)[3]\] requires that organization-defined security safeguards allocated to organization-defined locations and architectural layers are obtained from different suppliers.

## Control guidance

Different information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations (e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code.
