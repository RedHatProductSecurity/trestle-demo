# pl-7 - \[Planning\] Concept of Operations

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system describing how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security and privacy; and

- \[b.\] Review and update the CONOPS {{ insert: param, pl-07_odp }}.

## Control guidance

The CONOPS may be included in the security or privacy plans for the system or in other system development life cycle documents. The CONOPS is a living document that requires updating throughout the system development life cycle. For example, during system design reviews, the concept of operations is checked to ensure that it remains consistent with the design for controls, the system architecture, and the operational procedures. Changes to the CONOPS are reflected in ongoing updates to the security and privacy plans, security and privacy architectures, and other organizational documents, such as procurement specifications, system development life cycle documents, and systems engineering documents.

## Control assessment-objective

a CONOPS for the system describing how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security and privacy is developed;
the CONOPS is reviewed and updated {{ insert: param, pl-07_odp }}.
