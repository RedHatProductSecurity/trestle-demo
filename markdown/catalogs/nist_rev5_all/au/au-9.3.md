# au-9.3 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system:

- \[AU-9(3)[1]\] uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information; and

- \[AU-9(3)[2]\] uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit tools.

## Control guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.
