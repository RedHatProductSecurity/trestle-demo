# au-12.1 - \[Audit and Accountability\] System-wide / Time-correlated Audit Trail

## Control Statement

The information system compiles audit records from {{ insert: param, au-12.1_prm_1 }} into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within {{ insert: param, au-12.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-12(1)[1]\] the organization defines the information system components from which audit records are to be compiled into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail;

- \[AU-12(1)[2]\] the organization defines the level of tolerance for the relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail; and

- \[AU-12(1)[3]\] the information system compiles audit records from organization-defined information system components into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within the organization-defined level of tolerance for the relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail.

## Control guidance

Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
