# au-16 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Cross-organizational Auditing

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, au-16_prm_1 }} for coordinating {{ insert: param, au-16_prm_2 }} among external organizations when audit information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-16[1]\] defines audit information to be coordinated among external organizations when audit information is transmitted across organizational boundaries;

- \[AU-16[2]\] defines methods for coordinating organization-defined audit information among external organizations when audit information is transmitted across organizational boundaries; and

- \[AU-16[3]\] employs organization-defined methods for coordinating organization-defined audit information among external organizations when audit information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.

## Control guidance

When organizations use information systems and/or services of external organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals.
