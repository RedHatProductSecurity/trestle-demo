# au-12.3 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Changes by Authorized Individuals

## Control Statement

The information system provides the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.3_prm_1 }} to change the auditing to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.3_prm_2 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.3_prm_3 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.3_prm_4 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-12(3)[1]\] the organization defines information system components on which auditing is to be performed;

- \[AU-12(3)[2]\] the organization defines individuals or roles authorized to change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components;

- \[AU-12(3)[3]\] the organization defines time thresholds within which organization-defined individuals or roles can change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components;

- \[AU-12(3)[4]\] the organization defines selectable event criteria that support the capability for organization-defined individuals or roles to change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components; and

- \[AU-12(3)[5]\] the information system provides the capability for organization-defined individuals or roles to change the auditing to be performed on organization-defined information system components based on organization-defined selectable event criteria within organization-defined time thresholds.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours.
