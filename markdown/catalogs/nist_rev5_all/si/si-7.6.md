# si-7.6 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system employs cryptographic mechanism to detect unauthorized changes to:

- \[SI-7(6)[1]\] software;

- \[SI-7(6)[2]\] firmware; and

- \[SI-7(6)[3]\] information.

## Control guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.
