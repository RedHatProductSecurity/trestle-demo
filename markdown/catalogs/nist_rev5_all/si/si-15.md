# si-15 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Output Filtering

## Control Statement

The information system validates information output from {{ insert: param, si-15_prm_1 }} to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SI-15[1]\] the organization defines software programs and/or applications whose information output requires validation to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content; and

- \[SI-15[2]\] the information system validates information output from organization-defined software programs and/or applications to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content.

## Control guidance

Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools that anomalous behavior has been discovered.
