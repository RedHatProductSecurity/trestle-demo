# si-13.1 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Transferring Component Responsibilities

## Control Statement

The organization takes information system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than {{ insert: param, si-13.1_prm_1 }} of mean time to failure.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-13(1)[1]\] defines maximum fraction or percentage of mean time to failure within which to transfer the responsibilities of an information system component that is out of service to a substitute component; and

- \[SI-13(1)[2]\] takes the information system component out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than organization-defined fraction or percentage of mean time to failure.
