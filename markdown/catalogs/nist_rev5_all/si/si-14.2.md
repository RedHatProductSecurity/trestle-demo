## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] {{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.01 }} ; and

## Control guidance

Retaining information longer than is needed makes the information a potential target for advanced adversaries searching for high value assets to compromise through unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, or exfiltration. For system-related information, unnecessary retention provides advanced adversaries information that can assist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through the system.

## Control assessment-objective

{{ insert: param, si-14.02_odp.01 }} is performed;
information is deleted when no longer needed.
