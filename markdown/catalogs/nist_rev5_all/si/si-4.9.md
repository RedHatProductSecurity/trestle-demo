# si-4.9 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Testing of Monitoring Tools

## Control Statement

The organization tests intrusion-monitoring tools {{ insert: param, si-4.9_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-4(9)[1]\] defines a frequency to test intrusion-monitoring tools; and

- \[SI-4(9)[2]\] tests intrusion-monitoring tools with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Testing intrusion-monitoring tools is necessary to ensure that the tools are operating correctly and continue to meet the monitoring objectives of organizations. The frequency of testing depends on the types of tools used by organizations and methods of deployment.
