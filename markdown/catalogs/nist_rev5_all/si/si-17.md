# si-17 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Fail-safe Procedures

## Control Statement

The information system implements {{ insert: param, si-17_prm_1 }} when {{ insert: param, si-17_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SI-17[1]\] the organization defines fail-safe procedures to be implemented when organization-defined failure conditions occur;

- \[SI-17[2]\] the organization defines failure conditions resulting in organization-defined fail-safe procedures being implemented when such conditions occur; and

- \[SI-17[3]\] the information system implements organization-defined fail-safe procedures when organization-defined failure conditions occur.

## Control guidance

Failure conditions include, for example, loss of communications among critical system components or between system components and operational facilities. Fail-safe procedures include, for example, alerting operator personnel and providing specific instructions on subsequent steps to take (e.g., do nothing, reestablish system settings, shut down processes, restart the system, or contact designated organizational personnel).
