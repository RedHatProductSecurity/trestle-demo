# si-13.4 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Standby Component Installation and Notification

## Control Statement

If system component failures are detected:

- \[(a)\] Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within {{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] {{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.

## Control assessment-objective

the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within {{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.01 }} if system component failures are detected;
{{ insert: param, si-13.04_odp.02 }} are performed if system component failures are detected.
