# si-13.4 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Standby Component Installation / Notification

## Control Statement

The organization, if information system component failures are detected:

- \[(a)\] Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within {{ insert: param, si-13.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] {{ insert: param, si-13.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-13(4)(a)\]

  - \[SI-13(4)(a)[1]\] defines a time period for standby information system components to be successfully and transparently installed when information system component failures are detected;
  - \[SI-13(4)(a)[2]\] ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within the organization-defined time period;

- \[SI-13(4)(b)\]

  - \[SI-13(4)(b)[1]\] defines an alarm to be activated when information system component failures are detected;
  - \[SI-13(4)(b)[2]\] if information system component failures are detected, does one or more of the following:

    - \[SI-13(4)(b)[2][a]\] activates the organization-defined alarm; and/or
    - \[SI-13(4)(b)[2][b]\] automatically shuts down the information system.

## Control guidance

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur, for example, upon detection of component failures.
