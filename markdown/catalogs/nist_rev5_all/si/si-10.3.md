# si-10.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Predictable Behavior

## Control Statement

The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.

## Control guidance

A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures that there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse, unintended side effects.
