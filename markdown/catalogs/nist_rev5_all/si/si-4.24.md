# si-4.24 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Indicators of Compromise

## Control Statement

The information system discovers, collects, distributes, and uses indicators of compromise.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system:

- \[SI-4(24)[1]\] discovers indicators of compromise;

- \[SI-4(24)[2]\] collects indicators of compromise;

- \[SI-4(24)[3]\] distributes indicators of compromise; and

- \[SI-4(24)[4]\] uses indicators of compromise.

## Control guidance

Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs provide organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example, the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that information systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack.
