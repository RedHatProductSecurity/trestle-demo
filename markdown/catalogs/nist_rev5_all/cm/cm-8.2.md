# cm-8.2 - \[Configuration Management\] Automated Maintenance

## Control Statement

The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an inventory of information system components that is:

- \[CM-8(2)[1]\] up-to-date;

- \[CM-8(2)[2]\] complete;

- \[CM-8(2)[3]\] accurate; and

- \[CM-8(2)[4]\] readily available.

## Control guidance

Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent feasible. Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.
