# sa-16 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer-provided Training

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide {{ insert: param, sa-16_prm_1 }} on the correct use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-16[1]\] defines training to be provided by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service; and

- \[SA-16[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide organization-defined training on the correct use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.

## Control guidance

This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to organizational personnel. Organizations determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.
