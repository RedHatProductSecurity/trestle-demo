# sa-15.7 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Automated Vulnerability Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

- \[(a)\] Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using {{ insert: param, sa-15.7_prm_1 }};

- \[(b)\] Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;

- \[(c)\] Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and

- \[(d)\] Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to {{ insert: param, sa-15.7_prm_2 }}.

- \[SA-15(7)(b)\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;

- \[SA-15(7)(c)\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities;

- \[SA-15(7)(d)\]

  - \[SA-15(7)(d)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to whom the output of the tools and results of the analysis are to be delivered; and
  - \[SA-15(7)(d)[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to organization-defined personnel or roles.
