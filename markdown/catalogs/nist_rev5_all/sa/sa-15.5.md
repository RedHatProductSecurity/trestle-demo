# sa-15.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Attack Surface Reduction

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to reduce attack surfaces to {{ insert: param, sa-15.5_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-15(5)[1]\] defines thresholds to which attack surfaces are to be reduced; and

- \[SA-15(5)[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to reduce attack surfaces to organization-defined thresholds.

## Control guidance

Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat and vulnerability analyses and information system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within information systems, information system components, and information system services. Attack surface reduction includes, for example, applying the principle of least privilege, employing layered defenses, applying the principle of least functionality (i.e., restricting ports, protocols, functions, and services), deprecating unsafe functions, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber attacks.
