# sa-4.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] System / Component / Service Configurations

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

- \[(a)\] Deliver the system, component, or service with {{ insert: param, sa-4.5_prm_1 }} implemented; and

- \[(b)\] Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-4(5)(a)\]

  - \[SA-4(5)(a)[1]\] defines security configurations to be implemented by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;
  - \[SA-4(5)(a)[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to deliver the system, component, or service with organization-defined security configurations implemented; and

- \[SA-4(5)(b)\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## Control guidance

Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and services. Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords have been changed.
