# sa-20 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Customized Development of Critical Components

## Control Statement

The organization re-implements or custom develops {{ insert: param, sa-20_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-20[1]\] defines critical information system components to be re-implemented or custom developed; and

- \[SA-20[2]\] re-implements or custom develops organization-defined information system components.

## Control guidance

Organizations determine that certain information system components likely cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files.
