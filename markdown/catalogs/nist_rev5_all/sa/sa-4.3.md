# sa-4.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Development Methods / Techniques / Practices

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that includes {{ insert: param, sa-4.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-4(3)[1]\] defines state-of-the-practice system/security engineering methods to be included in the system development life cycle employed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-4(3)[2]\] defines software development methods to be included in the system development life cycle employed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-4(3)[3]\] defines testing/evaluation/validation techniques to be included in the system development life cycle employed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-4(3)[4]\] defines quality control processes to be included in the system development life cycle employed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-4(3)[5]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that includes:

  - \[SA-4(3)[5][a]\] organization-defined state-of-the-practice system/security engineering methods;
  - \[SA-4(3)[5][b]\] organization-defined software development methods;
  - \[SA-4(3)[5][c]\] organization-defined testing/evaluation/validation techniques; and
  - \[SA-4(3)[5][d]\] organization-defined quality control processes.

## Control guidance

Following a well-defined system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems/security engineering methods, quality control processes, and testing, evaluation, and validation techniques helps to reduce the number and severity of latent errors within information systems, system components, and information system services. Reducing the number/severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services.
