# sa-17.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Formal Correspondence

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

- \[(a)\] Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

- \[(b)\] Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

- \[(c)\] Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

- \[(d)\] Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

- \[(e)\] Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

- \[SA-17(3)(a)\] produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of:

  - \[SA-17(3)(a)[1]\] exceptions;
  - \[SA-17(3)(a)[2]\] error messages;
  - \[SA-17(3)(a)[3]\] effects;

- \[SA-17(3)(b)\] show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

- \[SA-17(3)(c)\] show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

- \[SA-17(3)(d)\] show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

- \[SA-17(3)(e)\] describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Control guidance

Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied by the formal information system description, and that the formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, for example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may require the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include, for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output.
