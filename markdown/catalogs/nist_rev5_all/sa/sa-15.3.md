# sa-15.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Criticality Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform a criticality analysis at {{ insert: param, sa-15.3_prm_1 }} and at {{ insert: param, sa-15.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-15(3)[1]\] defines the breadth of criticality analysis to be performed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-15(3)[2]\] defines the depth of criticality analysis to be performed by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service;

- \[SA-15(3)[3]\] defines decision points in the system development life cycle when a criticality analysis is to be performed for the information system, system component, or information system service; and

- \[SA-15(3)[4]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform a criticality analysis at the organization-defined breadth/depth and at organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement provides developer input to the criticality analysis performed by organizations in SA-14. Developer input is essential to such analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for information system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products (e.g., functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, and source code/hardware schematics).
