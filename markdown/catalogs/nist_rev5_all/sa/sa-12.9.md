# sa-12.9 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Operations Security

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sa-12.9_prm_1 }} in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information for the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-12(9)[1]\] defines Operations Security (OPSEC) safeguards to be employed in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information for the information system, system component, or information system service; and

- \[SA-12(9)[2]\] employs organization-defined OPSEC safeguards in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information for the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control guidance

Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses for information systems, information system components, and information system services; supplier identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing and evaluation results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement expands the scope of OPSEC to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process of identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to: (i) identify those actions that can be observed by potential adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to organizations; (iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level, exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may compromise the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations to withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or information system services.
