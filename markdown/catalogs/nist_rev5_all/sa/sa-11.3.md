# sa-11.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Independent Verification of Assessment Plans / Evidence

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Requires an independent agent satisfying {{ insert: param, sa-11.3_prm_1 }} to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation; and

- \[(b)\] Ensures that the independent agent is either provided with sufficient information to complete the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-11(3)(a)\]

  - \[SA-11(3)(a)[1]\] defines independence criteria that an independent agent is required to satisfy;
  - \[SA-11(3)(a)[2]\] requires an independent agent satisfying organization-defined independence criteria to verify:

    - \[SA-11(3)(a)[2][a]\] the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan;
    - \[SA-11(3)(a)[2][b]\] the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation;

- \[SA-11(3)(b)\] ensures that the independent agent is either:

  - \[SA-11(3)(b)[1]\] provided with sufficient information to complete the verification process; or
  - \[SA-11(3)(b)[2]\] granted the authority to obtain such information.

## Control guidance

Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise, skills, training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security assessment plans.
