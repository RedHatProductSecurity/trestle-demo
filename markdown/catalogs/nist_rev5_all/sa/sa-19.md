# sa-19 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Component Authenticity

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops and implements anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the information system; and

- \[b.\] Reports counterfeit information system components to {{ insert: param, sa-19_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-19(a)\] develops and implements anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the information system;

- \[SA-19(b)\]

  - \[SA-19(b)[1]\] defines external reporting organizations to whom counterfeit information system components are to be reported;
  - \[SA-19(b)[2]\] defines personnel or roles to whom counterfeit information system components are to be reported;
  - \[SA-19(b)[3]\] reports counterfeit information system components to one or more of the following:

    - \[SA-19(b)[3][a]\] the source of counterfeit component;
    - \[SA-19(b)[3][b]\] the organization-defined external reporting organizations; and/or
    - \[SA-19(b)[3][c]\] the organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

Sources of counterfeit components include, for example, manufacturers, developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policy and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include, for example, US-CERT.
