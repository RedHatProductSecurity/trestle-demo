# sr-3.1 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Diverse Supply Base

## Control Statement

Employ a diverse set of sources for the following system components and services: {{ insert: param, sr-3.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Diversifying the supply of systems, system components, and services can reduce the probability that adversaries will successfully identify and target the supply chain and can reduce the impact of a supply chain event or compromise. Identifying multiple suppliers for replacement components can reduce the probability that the replacement component will become unavailable. Employing a diverse set of developers or logistics service providers can reduce the impact of a natural disaster or other supply chain event. Organizations consider designing the system to include diverse materials and components.
