# ra-6 - \[Risk Assessment\] Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Survey

## Control Statement

The organization employs a technical surveillance countermeasures survey at {{ insert: param, ra-6_prm_1 }} {{ insert: param, ra-6_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[RA-6[1]\] defines locations to employ technical surveillance countermeasure surveys;

- \[RA-6[2]\] defines a frequency to employ technical surveillance countermeasure surveys;

- \[RA-6[3]\] defines events or indicators which, if they occur, trigger a technical surveillance countermeasures survey;

- \[RA-6[4]\] employs a technical surveillance countermeasures survey at organization-defined locations one or more of the following:

  - \[RA-6[4][a]\] with the organization-defined frequency; and/or
  - \[RA-6[4][b]\] when organization-defined events or indicators occur.

## Control guidance

Technical surveillance countermeasures surveys are performed by qualified personnel to detect the presence of technical surveillance devices/hazards and to identify technical security weaknesses that could aid in the conduct of technical penetrations of surveyed facilities. Such surveys provide evaluations of the technical security postures of organizations and facilities and typically include thorough visual, electronic, and physical examinations in and about surveyed facilities. The surveys also provide useful input into risk assessments and organizational exposure to potential adversaries.
