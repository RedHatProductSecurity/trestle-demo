# ra-5.4 - \[Risk Assessment\] Discoverable Information

## Control Statement

The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries and subsequently takes {{ insert: param, ra-5.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[RA-5(4)[1]\] defines corrective actions to be taken if information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries;

- \[RA-5(4)[2]\] determines what information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries; and

- \[RA-5(4)[3]\] subsequently takes organization-defined corrective actions.

## Control guidance

Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could obtain without directly compromising or breaching the information system, for example, by collecting information the system is exposing or by conducting extensive searches of the web. Corrective actions can include, for example, notifying appropriate organizational personnel, removing designated information, or changing the information system to make designated information less relevant or attractive to adversaries.
