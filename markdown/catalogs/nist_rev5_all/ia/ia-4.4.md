# ia-4.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Identify User Status

## Control Statement

The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as {{ insert: param, ia-4.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-4(4)[1]\] defines a characteristic to be used to identify individual status; and

- \[IA-4(4)[2]\] manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as the organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status.

## Control guidance

Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for example, contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.
