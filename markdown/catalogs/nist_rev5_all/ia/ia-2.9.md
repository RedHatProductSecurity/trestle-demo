# ia-2.9 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Network Access to Non-privileged Accounts - Replay Resistant

## Control Statement

The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to non-privileged accounts.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to non-privileged accounts.

## Control guidance

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by recording/replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
