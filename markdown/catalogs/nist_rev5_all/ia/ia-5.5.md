# ia-5.5 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Change Authenticators Prior to Delivery

## Control Statement

The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires developers/installers of information system components to:

- \[IA-5(5)[1]\] provide unique authenticators prior to delivery/installation; or

- \[IA-5(5)[2]\] change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system components.
