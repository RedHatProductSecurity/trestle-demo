# ia-3.1 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Cryptographic Bidirectional Authentication

## Control Statement

Authenticate {{ insert: param, ia-03.01_odp.01 }} before establishing {{ insert: param, ia-03.01_odp.02 }} connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.

## Control guidance

A local connection is a connection with a device that communicates without the use of a network. A network connection is a connection with a device that communicates through a network. A remote connection is a connection with a device that communicates through an external network. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger protection to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.

## Control assessment-objective

{{ insert: param, ia-03.01_odp.01 }} are authenticated before establishing {{ insert: param, ia-03.01_odp.02 }} connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.
