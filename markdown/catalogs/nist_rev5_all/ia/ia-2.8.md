# ia-2.8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Access to Accounts â€” Replay Resistant

## Control Statement

Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to {{ insert: param, ia-02.08_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.

## Control assessment-objective

replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to {{ insert: param, ia-02.08_odp }} are implemented.
