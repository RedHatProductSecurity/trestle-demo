# ia-5.8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Multiple Information System Accounts

## Control Statement

The organization implements {{ insert: param, ia-5.8_prm_1 }} to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-5(8)[1]\] defines security safeguards to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems; and

- \[IA-5(8)[2]\] implements organization-defined security safeguards to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.

## Control guidance

When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems, there is the risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives include, for example: (i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on mechanism; or (iii) including some form of one-time passwords on all systems.
