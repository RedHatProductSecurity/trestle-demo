# sc-36.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Polling Techniques

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Employ polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to the following processing and storage components: {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Take the following actions in response to identified faults, errors, or compromises: {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational information and systems. However, the distribution of processing and storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one or more of the components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the distributed components and subsequently votes on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, compromises, or errors in the distributed processing and storage components.

## Control assessment-objective

polling techniques are employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.01 }};
{{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.02 }} are taken in response to identified faults, errors, or compromise.
