# sa-15.7 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Automated Vulnerability Analysis

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }} to:

- \[(a)\] Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.02 }};

- \[(b)\] Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;

- \[(c)\] Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and

- \[(d)\] Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or deficiencies in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations for risk mitigations.
