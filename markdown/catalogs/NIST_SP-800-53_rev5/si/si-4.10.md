## Control Statement

Make provisions so that {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.01 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.

## Control assessment-objective
