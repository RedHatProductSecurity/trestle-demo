# cp-4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Contingency Plan Testing

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Test the contingency plan for the system {{ insert: param, cp-04_odp.01 }} using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: {{ insert: param, cp-4_prm_2 }}.

- \[b.\] Review the contingency plan test results; and

- \[c.\] Initiate corrective actions, if needed.

## Control guidance

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.

## Control assessment-objective
