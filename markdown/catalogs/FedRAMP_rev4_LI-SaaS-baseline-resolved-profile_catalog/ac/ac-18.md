Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
NSO - All access to Cloud SaaS are via web services and/or API. The device accessed from or whether via wired or wireless connection is out of scope. Regardless of device accessed from, must utilize approved remote access methods (AC-17), secure communication with strong encryption (SC-13), key management (SC-12), and multi-factor authentication for privileged access (IA-2[1]).
