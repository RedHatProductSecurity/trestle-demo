# ca-9 - \[Security Assessment and Authorization\] Internal System Connections

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Authorizes internal connections of {{ insert: param, ca-9_prm_1 }} to the information system; and

- \[b.\] Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:    * Defines information system components or classes of components to be authorized as internal connections to the information system.  * Authorizes internal connections of organization-defined information system components or classes of components to the information system.  * Documents, for each internal connection:  *     * The interface characteristics;   * The security requirements; and   * The nature of the information communicated.    

## Control guidance

This control applies to connections between organizational information systems and (separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections) including, for example, system connections with mobile devices, notebook/desktop computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual internal connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of components with common characteristics and/or configurations, for example, all digital printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, storage, and transmission capability or all smart phones with a specific baseline configuration.
Condition: There are connection(s) to external systems. Connections (if any) shall be authorized and must: 1) Identify the interface/connection. 2) Detail what data is involved and its sensitivity. 3) Determine whether the connection is one-way or bi-directional. 4) Identify how the connection is secured.
