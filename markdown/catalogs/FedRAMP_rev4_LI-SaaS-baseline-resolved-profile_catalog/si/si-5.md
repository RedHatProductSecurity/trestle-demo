# si-5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Receives information system security alerts, advisories, and directives from {{ insert: param, si-5_prm_1 }} on an ongoing basis;

- \[b.\] Generates internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;

- \[c.\] Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to: {{ insert: param, si-5_prm_2 }}; and

## Control guidance

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations.
