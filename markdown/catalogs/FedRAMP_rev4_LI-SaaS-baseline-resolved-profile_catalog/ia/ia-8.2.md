# ia-8.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of Third-party Credentials

## Control Statement

The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement typically applies to organizational information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. Third-party credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions initiative. Approved third-party credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. This allows federal government relying parties to trust such credentials at their approved assurance levels.
Condition: Must document and assess for privileged users. May attest to this control for non-privileged users. FedRAMP requires a minimum of multi-factor authentication for all Federal privileged users, if acceptance of PIV credentials is not supported. The implementation status and details of how this control is implemented must be clearly defined by the CSP.
