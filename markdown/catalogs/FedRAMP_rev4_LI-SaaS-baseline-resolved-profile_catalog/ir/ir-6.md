# ir-6 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Reporting

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within {{ insert: param, ir-6_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b.\] Reports security incident information to {{ insert: param, ir-6_prm_2 }}.

- \[ir-6_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] Report security incident information according to FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedure.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:    * Defines the time period within which personnel report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability.  * Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within the organization-defined time period.  * Defines authorities to whom security incident information is to be reported.  * Reports security incident information to organization-defined authorities.  

## Control guidance

The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.
