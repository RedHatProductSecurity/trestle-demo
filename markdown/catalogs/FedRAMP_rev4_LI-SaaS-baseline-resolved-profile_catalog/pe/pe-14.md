# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Temperature and Humidity Controls

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b.\] Monitors temperature and humidity levels {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_2 }}.

- \[pe-14_fr\]

  - \[(a) Requirement:\] The service provider measures temperature at server inlets and humidity levels by dew point.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:    * defines acceptable temperature levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;  * defines acceptable humidity levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;  * maintains temperature levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;  * maintains humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;  * defines the frequency to monitor temperature levels;  * defines the frequency to monitor humidity levels;  * monitors temperature levels with the organization-defined frequency; and  * monitors humidity levels with the organization-defined frequency.  

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.
Condition: Control is not inherited from a FedRAMP-authorized PaaS or IaaS.
