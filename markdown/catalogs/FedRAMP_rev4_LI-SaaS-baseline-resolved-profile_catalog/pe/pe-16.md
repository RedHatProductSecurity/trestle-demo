# pe-16 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Delivery and Removal

## Control Statement

The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls {{ insert: param, pe-16_prm_1 }} entering and exiting the facility and maintains records of those items.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:    * defines types of information system components to be authorized, monitored, and controlled as such components are entering and exiting the facility;  * authorizes organization-defined information system components entering the facility;  * monitors organization-defined information system components entering the facility;  * controls organization-defined information system components entering the facility;  * authorizes organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;  * monitors organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;  * controls organization-defined information system components exiting the facility;  * maintains records of information system components entering the facility; and  * maintains records of information system components exiting the facility.  

## Control guidance

Effectively enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of information system components may require restricting access to delivery areas and possibly isolating the areas from the information system and media libraries.
Condition: Control is not inherited from a FedRAMP-authorized PaaS or IaaS.
