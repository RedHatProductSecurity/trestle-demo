# cm-3.4 - \[Configuration Management\] Security Representative

## Control Statement

The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the {{ insert: param, cm-3.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-3(4)[1]\] specifies the configuration change control elements (as defined in CM-3g) of which an information security representative is to be a member; and

- \[CM-3(4)[2]\] requires an information security representative to be a member of the specified configuration control element.

## Control guidance

Information security representatives can include, for example, senior agency information security officers, information system security officers, or information system security managers. Representation by personnel with information security expertise is important because changes to information system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of organizational information systems. The configuration change control element in this control enhancement reflects the change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3.
