# cm-8.7 - \[Configuration Management\] Centralized Repository

## Control Statement

The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system components.

## Control guidance

Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner).
