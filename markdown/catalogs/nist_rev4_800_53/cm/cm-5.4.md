# cm-5.4 - \[Configuration Management\] Dual Authorization

## Control Statement

The organization enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to {{ insert: param, cm-5.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-5(4)[1]\] defines information system components and system-level information requiring dual authorization to be enforced when implementing changes; and

- \[CM-5(4)[2]\] enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to organization-defined information system components and system-level information.

## Control guidance

Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that any changes to selected information system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals implement such changes. The two individuals possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.
