# cm-2.7 - \[Configuration Management\] Configure Systems, Components, or Devices for High-risk Areas

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Issues {{ insert: param, cm-2.7_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, cm-2.7_prm_2 }} to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk; and

- \[(b)\] Applies {{ insert: param, cm-2.7_prm_3 }} to the devices when the individuals return.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CM-2(7)(a)\]

  - \[CM-2(7)(a)[1]\] defines information systems, system components, or devices to be issued to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk;
  - \[CM-2(7)(a)[2]\] defines configurations to be employed on organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices issued to individuals traveling to such locations;
  - \[CM-2(7)(a)[3]\] issues organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices with organization-defined configurations to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk;

- \[CM-2(7)(b)\]

  - \[CM-2(7)(b)[1]\] defines security safeguards to be applied to the devices when the individuals return; and
  - \[CM-2(7)(b)[2]\] applies organization-defined safeguards to the devices when the individuals return.

## Control guidance

When it is known that information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas, additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas coupled with the lack of physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For example, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media protection family.
