# cm-3.2 - \[Configuration Management\] Test / Validate / Document Changes

## Control Statement

The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before implementing the changes on the operational system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization, before implementing changes on the operational system:

- \[CM-3(2)[1]\] tests changes to the information system;

- \[CM-3(2)[2]\] validates changes to the information system; and

- \[CM-3(2)[3]\] documents changes to the information system.

## Control guidance

Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups conducting tests understand organizational security policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).
