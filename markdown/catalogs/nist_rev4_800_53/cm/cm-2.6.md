# cm-2.6 - \[Configuration Management\] Development and Test Environments

## Control Statement

The organization maintains a baseline configuration for information system development and test environments that is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization maintains a baseline configuration for information system development and test environments that is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.

## Control guidance

Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments.
