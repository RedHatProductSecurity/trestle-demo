# cm-5.2 - \[Configuration Management\] Review System Changes

## Control Statement

The organization reviews information system changes {{ insert: param, cm-5.2_prm_1 }} and {{ insert: param, cm-5.2_prm_2 }} to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization, in an effort to ascertain whether unauthorized changes have occurred:

- \[CM-5(2)[1]\] defines the frequency to review information system changes;

- \[CM-5(2)[2]\] defines circumstances that warrant review of information system changes;

- \[CM-5(2)[3]\] reviews information system changes with the organization-defined frequency; and

- \[CM-5(2)[4]\] reviews information system changes with the organization-defined circumstances.

## Control guidance

Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the specific circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried out by organizations during the configuration change process.
