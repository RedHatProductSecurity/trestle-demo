  - \[MA-5(1)(a)(1)\] maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations, clearances, or formal access approvals are escorted and supervised during the performance of maintenance and diagnostic activities on the information system by approved organizational personnel who:

    - \[MA-5(1)(a)(2)[1]\] all volatile information storage components within the information system are sanitized; and
    - \[MA-5(1)(a)(2)[2]\] all nonvolatile storage media are removed; or
    - \[MA-5(1)(a)(2)[3]\] all nonvolatile storage media are physically disconnected from the system and secured; and

## Control guidance

This control enhancement denies individuals who lack appropriate security clearances (i.e., individuals who do not possess security clearances or possess security clearances at a lower level than required) or who are not U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to any classified information, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), or any other sensitive information contained on organizational information systems. Procedures for the use of maintenance personnel can be documented in security plans for the information systems.
