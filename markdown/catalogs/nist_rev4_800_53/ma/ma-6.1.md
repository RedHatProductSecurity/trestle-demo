# ma-6.1 - \[Maintenance\] Preventive Maintenance

## Control Statement

The organization performs preventive maintenance on {{ insert: param, ma-6.1_prm_1 }} at {{ insert: param, ma-6.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MA-6(1)[1]\] defines information system components on which preventive maintenance is to be performed;

- \[MA-6(1)[2]\] defines time intervals within which preventive maintenance is to be performed on organization-defined information system components; and

- \[MA-6(1)[3]\] performs preventive maintenance on organization-defined information system components at organization-defined time intervals.

## Control guidance

Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of organizational information systems components for the purpose of maintaining equipment and facilities in satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes, legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.
