# ma-4.4 - \[Maintenance\] Authentication / Separation of Maintenance Sessions

## Control Statement

The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

- \[(a)\] Employing {{ insert: param, ma-4.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the information system by either:

  - \[(1)\] Physically separated communications paths; or
  - \[(2)\] Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

- \[MA-4(4)(a)\]

  - \[MA-4(4)(a)[1]\] defining replay resistant authenticators to be employed to protect nonlocal maintenance sessions;
  - \[MA-4(4)(a)[2]\] employing organization-defined authenticators that are replay resistant;

- \[MA-4(4)(b)\] separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the information system by either:

  - \[MA-4(4)(b)(1)\] physically separated communications paths; or
  - \[MA-4(4)(b)(2)\] logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.
