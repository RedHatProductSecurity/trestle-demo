# ma-6.2 - \[Maintenance\] Predictive Maintenance

## Control Statement

The organization performs predictive maintenance on {{ insert: param, ma-6.2_prm_1 }} at {{ insert: param, ma-6.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MA-6(2)[1]\] defines information system components on which predictive maintenance is to be performed;

- \[MA-6(2)[2]\] defines time intervals within which predictive maintenance is to be performed on organization-defined information system components; and

- \[MA-6(2)[3]\] performs predictive maintenance on organization-defined information system components at organization-defined time intervals.

## Control guidance

Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.
