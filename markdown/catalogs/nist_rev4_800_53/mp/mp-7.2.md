# mp-7.2 - \[Media Protection\] Prohibit Use of Sanitization-resistant Media

## Control Statement

The organization prohibits the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational information systems.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization prohibits the use of sanitization-resistant media in organizational information systems.

## Control guidance

Sanitization-resistance applies to the capability to purge information from media. Certain types of media do not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the interfaces are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitization-resistant media include, for example, compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB removable media.
