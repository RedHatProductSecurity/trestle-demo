# mp-3 - \[Media Protection\] Media Marking

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Marks information system media indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats, and applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and

- \[b.\] Exempts {{ insert: param, mp-3_prm_1 }} from marking as long as the media remain within {{ insert: param, mp-3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MP-3(a)\] marks information system media indicating the:

  - \[MP-3(a)[1]\] distribution limitations of the information;
  - \[MP-3(a)[2]\] handling caveats of the information;
  - \[MP-3(a)[3]\] applicable security markings (if any) of the information;

- \[MP-3(b)\]

  - \[MP-3(b)[1]\] defines types of information system media to be exempted from marking as long as the media remain in designated controlled areas;
  - \[MP-3(b)[2]\] defines controlled areas where organization-defined types of information system media exempt from marking are to be retained; and
  - \[MP-3(b)[3]\] exempts organization-defined types of information system media from marking as long as the media remain within organization-defined controlled areas.

## Control guidance

The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within information systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
