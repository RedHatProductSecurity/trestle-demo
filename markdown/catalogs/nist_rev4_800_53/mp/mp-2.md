# mp-2 - \[Media Protection\] Media Access

## Control Statement

The organization restricts access to {{ insert: param, mp-2_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, mp-2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[MP-2[1]\] defines types of digital and/or non-digital media requiring restricted access;

- \[MP-2[2]\] defines personnel or roles authorized to access organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media; and

- \[MP-2[3]\] restricts access to organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Restricting non-digital media access includes, for example, denying access to patient medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare providers. Restricting access to digital media includes, for example, limiting access to design specifications stored on compact disks in the media library to the project leader and the individuals on the development team.
