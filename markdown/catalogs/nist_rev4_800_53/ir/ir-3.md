# ir-3 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Response Testing

## Control Statement

The organization tests the incident response capability for the information system {{ insert: param, ir-3_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, ir-3_prm_2 }} to determine the incident response effectiveness and documents the results.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-3[1]\] defines incident response tests to test the incident response capability for the information system;

- \[IR-3[2]\] defines the frequency to test the incident response capability for the information system; and

- \[IR-3[3]\] tests the incident response capability for the information system with the organization-defined frequency, using organization-defined tests to determine the incident response effectiveness and documents the results.

## Control guidance

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response.
