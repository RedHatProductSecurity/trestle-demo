# ir-4.3 - \[Incident Response\] Continuity of Operations

## Control Statement

The organization identifies {{ insert: param, ir-4.3_prm_1 }} and {{ insert: param, ir-4.3_prm_2 }} to ensure continuation of organizational missions and business functions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IR-4(3)[1]\] defines classes of incidents requiring an organization-defined action to be taken;

- \[IR-4(3)[2]\] defines actions to be taken in response to organization-defined classes of incidents; and

- \[IR-4(3)[3]\] identifies organization-defined classes of incidents and organization-defined actions to take in response to classes of incidents to ensure continuation of organizational missions and business functions.

## Control guidance

Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack.
