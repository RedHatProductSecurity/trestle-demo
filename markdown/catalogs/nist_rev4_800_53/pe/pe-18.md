# pe-18 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Location of Information System Components

## Control Statement

The organization positions information system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_prm_1 }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-18[1]\] defines physical hazards that could result in potential damage to information system components within the facility;

- \[PE-18[2]\] defines environmental hazards that could result in potential damage to information system components within the facility;

- \[PE-18[3]\] positions information system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from organization-defined physical and environmental hazards; and

- \[PE-18[4]\] positions information system components within the facility to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control guidance

Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. In addition, organizations consider the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be in close proximity to information systems and therefore increase the potential for unauthorized access to organizational communications (e.g., through the use of wireless sniffers or microphones).
