# pe-3.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Information System Access

## Control Statement

The organization enforces physical access authorizations to the information system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-3.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-3(1)[1]\] defines physical spaces containing one or more components of the information system; and

- \[PE-3(1)[2]\] enforces physical access authorizations to the information system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more components of the information system.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of information system components (e.g., server rooms, media storage areas, data and communications centers).
