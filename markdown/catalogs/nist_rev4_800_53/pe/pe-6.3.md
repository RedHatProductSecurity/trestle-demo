# pe-6.3 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Video Surveillance

## Control Statement

The organization employs video surveillance of {{ insert: param, pe-6.3_prm_1 }} and retains video recordings for {{ insert: param, pe-6.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-6(3)[1]\] defines operational areas where video surveillance is to be employed;

- \[PE-6(3)[2]\] defines a time period to retain video recordings of organization-defined operational areas;

- \[PE-6(3)[3]\]

  - \[PE-6(3)[3][a]\] employs video surveillance of organization-defined operational areas; and
  - \[PE-6(3)[3][b]\] retains video recordings for the organization-defined time period.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement focuses on recording surveillance video for purposes of subsequent review, if circumstances so warrant (e.g., a break-in detected by other means). It does not require monitoring surveillance video although organizations may choose to do so. Note that there may be legal considerations when performing and retaining video surveillance, especially if such surveillance is in a public location.
