## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-6(4)[1]\] defines physical spaces containing one or more components of the information system; and

- \[PE-6(4)[2]\] monitors physical access to the information system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more components of the information system.
