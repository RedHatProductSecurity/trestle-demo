# pe-3.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Facility / Information System Boundaries

## Control Statement

The organization performs security checks {{ insert: param, pe-3.2_prm_1 }} at the physical boundary of the facility or information system for unauthorized exfiltration of information or removal of information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PE-3(2)[1]\] defines the frequency to perform security checks at the physical boundary of the facility or information system for:

  - \[PE-3(2)[1][a]\] unauthorized exfiltration of information; or
  - \[PE-3(2)[1][b]\] removal of information system components; and

- \[PE-3(2)[2]\] performs security checks with the organization-defined frequency at the physical boundary of the facility or information system for:

  - \[PE-3(2)[2][a]\] unauthorized exfiltration of information; or
  - \[PE-3(2)[2][b]\] removal of information system components.

## Control guidance

Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.
