# sa-21 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer Screening

## Control Statement

The organization requires that the developer of {{ insert: param, sa-21_prm_1 }}:

- \[a.\] Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned {{ insert: param, sa-21_prm_2 }}; and

- \[b.\] Satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-21_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-21[1]\] defines the information system, system component, or information system service for which the developer is to be screened;

- \[SA-21[2]\] defines official government duties to be used to determine appropriate access authorizations for the developer;

- \[SA-21[3]\] defines additional personnel screening criteria to be satisfied by the developer;

- \[SA-21[4]\]

  - \[SA-21[4][a]\] requires that the developer of organization-defined information system, system component, or information system service have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned organization-defined official government duties; and
  - \[SA-21[4][b]\] requires that the developer of organization-defined information system, system component, or information system service satisfy organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria.

## Control guidance

Because the information system, system component, or information system service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.
