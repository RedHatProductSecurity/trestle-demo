# sa-10.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Hardware Integrity Verification

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers. Organizations verify the integrity of hardware components, for example, with hard-to-copy labels and verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and by requiring the implementation of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components also include updates to such components.
