# sa-18.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Multiple Phases of SDLC

## Control Statement

The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and maintenance.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the system development life cycle including:

- \[SA-18(1)[1]\] design;

- \[SA-18(1)[2]\] development;

- \[SA-18(1)[3]\] integration;

- \[SA-18(1)[4]\] operations; and

- \[SA-18(1)[5]\] maintenance.

## Control guidance

Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.
