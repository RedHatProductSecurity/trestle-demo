# sa-18.2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Inspection of Information Systems, Components, or Devices

## Control Statement

The organization inspects {{ insert: param, sa-18.2_prm_1 }} {{ insert: param, sa-18.2_prm_2 }} to detect tampering.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-18(2)[1]\] defines information systems, system components, or devices to be inspected to detect tampering;

- \[SA-18(2)[2]\] defines the frequency to inspect organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices to detect tampering;

- \[SA-18(2)[3]\] defines indications of need for inspection of organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices to detect tampering;

- \[SA-18(2)[4]\] inspects organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices to detect tampering, selecting one or more of the following:

  - \[SA-18(2)[4][a]\] at random;
  - \[SA-18(2)[4][b]\] with the organization-defined frequency; and/or
  - \[SA-18(2)[4][c]\] upon organization-defined indications of need for inspection.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses both physical and logical tampering and is typically applied to mobile devices, notebook computers, or other system components taken out of organization-controlled areas. Indications of need for inspection include, for example, when individuals return from travel to high-risk locations.
