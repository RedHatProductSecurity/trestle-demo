# sa-10.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Software / Firmware Integrity Verification

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such components.
