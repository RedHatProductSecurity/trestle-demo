# sa-12.11 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Penetration Testing / Analysis of Elements, Processes, and Actors

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sa-12.11_prm_1 }} of {{ insert: param, sa-12.11_prm_2 }} associated with the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-12(11)[1]\] defines supply chain:

  - \[SA-12(11)[1][a]\] elements to be analyzed and/or tested;
  - \[SA-12(11)[1][b]\] processes to be analyzed and/or tested;
  - \[SA-12(11)[1][c]\] actors to be analyzed and/or tested;

- \[SA-12(11)[2]\] employs one or more of the following to analyze and/or test organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors associated with the information system, system component, or information system service:

  - \[SA-12(11)[2][a]\] organizational analysis;
  - \[SA-12(11)[2][b]\] independent third party analysis;
  - \[SA-12(11)[2][c]\] organizational penetration testing; and/or
  - \[SA-12(11)[2][d]\] independent third-party penetration testing.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the supply chain, not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology products or product components that contain programmable logic and that are critically important to information system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i) hardware, software, and firmware development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures; (iii) personnel and physical security programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures to maintain provenance; or (v) any other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production/distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated during analyses and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is documented and used to inform organizational risk management activities and decisions.
