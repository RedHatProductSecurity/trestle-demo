# sa-11.7 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Verify Scope of Testing / Evaluation

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage of required security controls at {{ insert: param, sa-11.7_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-11(7)[1]\] defines the depth of testing/evaluation to ensure the scope of security/testing evaluation provides complete coverage of required security controls; and

- \[SA-11(7)[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage of required security controls at the organization-defined depth of testing/evaluation.

## Control guidance

Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage of required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance corresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security control coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal modeling and analysis techniques including correlation between control implementation and corresponding test cases.
