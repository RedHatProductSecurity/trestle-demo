# sa-22.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Alternative Sources for Continued Support

## Control Statement

The organization provides {{ insert: param, sa-22.1_prm_1 }} for unsupported information system components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-22(1)[1]\] defines support from external providers to be provided for unsupported information system components;

- \[SA-22(1)[2]\] provides and/or obtains support for unsupported information system components from one or more of the following:

  - \[SA-22(1)[2][a]\] in-house support; and/or
  - \[SA-22(1)[2][b]\] organization-defined support from external providers.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses the need to provide continued support for selected information system components that are no longer supported by the original developers, vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain essential to mission/business operations. Organizations can establish in-house support, for example, by developing customized patches for critical software components or secure the services of external providers who through contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components. Such contractual relationships can include, for example, Open Source Software value-added vendors.
