# sa-21.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Validation of Screening

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service take {{ insert: param, sa-21.1_prm_1 }} to ensure that the required access authorizations and screening criteria are satisfied.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-21(1)[1]\] defines actions to be taken by the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to ensure that the required access authorizations and screening criteria are satisfied; and

- \[SA-21(1)[2]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service take organization-defined actions to ensure that the required access authorizations and screening criteria are satisfied.

## Control guidance

Satisfying required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria includes, for example, providing a listing of all the individuals authorized to perform development activities on the selected information system, system component, or information system service so that organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied the necessary authorization and screening requirements.
