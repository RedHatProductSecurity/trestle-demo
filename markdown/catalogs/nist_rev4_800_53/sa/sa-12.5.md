# sa-12.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Limitation of Harm

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sa-12.5_prm_1 }} to limit harm from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-12(5)[1]\] defines security safeguards to be employed to limit harm from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain; and

- \[SA-12(5)[2]\] employs organization-defined security safeguards to limit harm from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.

## Control guidance

Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT). Security safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully identifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of custom configurations to reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or products that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations; (ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists with standing reputations in industry, and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to commitments or obligations).
