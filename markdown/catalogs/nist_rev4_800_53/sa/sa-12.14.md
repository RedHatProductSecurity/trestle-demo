# sa-12.14 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Identity and Traceability

## Control Statement

The organization establishes and retains unique identification of {{ insert: param, sa-12.14_prm_1 }} for the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-12(14)[1]\] defines the following for the establishment and retention of unique identification:

  - \[SA-12(14)[1][a]\] supply chain elements;
  - \[SA-12(14)[1][b]\] supply chain processes;
  - \[SA-12(14)[1][c]\] supply chain actors; and

- \[SA-12(14)[2]\] establishes and retains unique identification of organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors for the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control guidance

Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for organizations to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission and element processes, testing and evaluation procedures, delivery mechanisms, support mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain elements including software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with those elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.
