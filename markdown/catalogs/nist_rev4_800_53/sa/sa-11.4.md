# sa-11.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Manual Code Reviews

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform a manual code review of {{ insert: param, sa-11.4_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, sa-11.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-11(4)[1]\] defines specific code for which the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service is required to perform a manual code review;

- \[SA-11(4)[2]\] defines processes, procedures, and/or techniques to be used when the developer performs a manual code review of organization-defined specific code; and

- \[SA-11(4)[3]\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform a manual code review of organization-defined specific code using organization-defined processes, procedures, and/or techniques.

## Control guidance

Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and firmware components of information systems. Such code reviews are uniquely effective at identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the applicationâ€™s requirements or context which are generally unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as static or dynamic analysis. Components benefiting from manual review include for example, verifying access control matrices against application controls and reviewing more detailed aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.
