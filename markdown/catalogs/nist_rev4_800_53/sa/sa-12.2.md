# sa-12.2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Supplier Reviews

## Control Statement

The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.

## Control guidance

Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier processes used to design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information systems, system components, and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier training and experience in developing systems, components, or services with the required security capability. These reviews provide organizations with increased levels of visibility into supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting subordinate suppliers, for example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.
