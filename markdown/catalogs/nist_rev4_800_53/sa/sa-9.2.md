# sa-9.2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Identification of Functions / Ports / Protocols / Services

## Control Statement

The organization requires providers of {{ insert: param, sa-9.2_prm_1 }} to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use of such services.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SA-9(2)[1]\] defines external information system services for which providers of such services are to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use of such services;

- \[SA-9(2)[2]\] requires providers of organization-defined external information system services to identify:

  - \[SA-9(2)[2][a]\] the functions required for the use of such services;
  - \[SA-9(2)[2][b]\] the ports required for the use of such services;
  - \[SA-9(2)[2][c]\] the protocols required for the use of such services; and
  - \[SA-9(2)[2][d]\] the other services required for the use of such services.

## Control guidance

Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be particularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols.
