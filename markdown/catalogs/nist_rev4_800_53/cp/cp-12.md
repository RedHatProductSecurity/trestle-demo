# cp-12 - \[Contingency Planning\] Safe Mode

## Control Statement

The information system, when {{ insert: param, cp-12_prm_1 }} are detected, enters a safe mode of operation with {{ insert: param, cp-12_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[CP-12[1]\] the organization defines conditions that, when detected, requires the information system to enter a safe mode of operation;

- \[CP-12[2]\] the organization defines restrictions of safe mode of operation; and

- \[CP-12[3]\] the information system, when organization-defined conditions are detected, enters a safe mode of operation with organization-defined restrictions of safe mode of operation.

## Control guidance

For information systems supporting critical missions/business functions including, for example, military operations and weapons systems, civilian space operations, nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control operations (especially real-time operational environments), organizations may choose to identify certain conditions under which those systems revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe mode of operation, which can be activated automatically or manually, restricts the types of activities or operations information systems could execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction includes, for example, allowing only certain functions that could be carried out under limited power or with reduced communications bandwidth.
