# cp-2.4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Resume All Missions / Business Functions

## Control Statement

The organization plans for the resumption of all missions and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-2.4_prm_1 }} of contingency plan activation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-2(4)[1]\] defines the time period to plan for the resumption of all missions and business functions as a result of contingency plan activation; and

- \[CP-2(4)[2]\] plans for the resumption of all missions and business functions within organization-defined time period of contingency plan activation.

## Control guidance

Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. The time period for resumption of all missions/business functions may be dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions to the information system and its supporting infrastructure.
