# cp-2.2 - \[Contingency Planning\] Capacity Planning

## Control Statement

The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity exists during contingency operations for:

- \[CP-2(2)[1]\] information processing;

- \[CP-2(2)[2]\] telecommunications; and

- \[CP-2(2)[3]\] environmental support.

## Control guidance

Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., natural disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning.
