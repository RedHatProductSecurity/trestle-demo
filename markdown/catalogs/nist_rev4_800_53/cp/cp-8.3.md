# cp-8.3 - \[Contingency Planning\] Separation of Primary / Alternate Providers

## Control Statement

The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization obtains alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

## Control guidance

Threats that affect telecommunications services are typically defined in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber/physical attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations seek to reduce common susceptibilities by, for example, minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services meeting the separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.
