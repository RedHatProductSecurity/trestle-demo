## Control Statement

The organization provides the capability to restore information system components within {{ insert: param, cp-10.4_prm_1 }} from configuration-controlled and integrity-protected information representing a known, operational state for the components.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-10(4)[1]\] defines a time period to restore information system components from configuration-controlled and integrity-protected information representing a known, operational state for the components; and

- \[CP-10(4)[2]\] provides the capability to restore information system components within the organization-defined time period from configuration-controlled and integrity-protected information representing a known, operational state for the components.

## Control guidance

Restoration of information system components includes, for example, reimaging which restores components to known, operational states.
