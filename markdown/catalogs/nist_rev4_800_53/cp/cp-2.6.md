# cp-2.6 - \[Contingency Planning\] Alternate Processing / Storage Site

## Control Statement

The organization plans for the transfer of essential missions and business functions to alternate processing and/or storage sites with little or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity through information system restoration to primary processing and/or storage sites.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-2(6)[1]\] plans for the transfer of essential missions and business functions to alternate processing and/or storage sites with little or no loss of operational continuity; and

- \[CP-2(6)[2]\] sustains that operational continuity through information system restoration to primary processing and/or storage sites.

## Control guidance

Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations as part of contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the contingency (e.g., backup sites may become primary sites).
