# cp-9.7 - \[Contingency Planning\] Dual Authorization

## Control Statement

The organization enforces dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of {{ insert: param, cp-9.7_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CP-9(7)[1]\] defines backup information that requires dual authorization to be enforced for the deletion or destruction of such information; and

- \[CP-9(7)[2]\] enforces dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of organization-defined backup information.

## Control guidance

Dual authorization ensures that the deletion or destruction of backup information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals carry out the task. Individuals deleting/destroying backup information possess sufficient skills/expertise to determine if the proposed deletion/destruction of backup information reflects organizational policies and procedures. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.
