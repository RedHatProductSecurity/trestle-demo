# pm-1 - \[Program Management\] Information Security Program Plan

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:

  - \[1.\] Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements;
  - \[2.\] Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
  - \[3.\] Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and
  - \[4.\] Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;

- \[b.\] Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan {{ insert: param, pm-1_prm_1 }};

- \[c.\] Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and

- \[d.\] Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PM-1(a)\] develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:

  - \[PM-1(a)(1)\]

    - \[PM-1(a)(1)[1]\] provides an overview of the requirements for the security program;
    - \[PM-1(a)(1)[2]\] provides a description of the:

      - \[PM-1(a)(1)[2][a]\] security program management controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements;
      - \[PM-1(a)(1)[2][b]\] common controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements;

  - \[PM-1(a)(2)\] includes the identification and assignment of:

    - \[PM-1(a)(2)[1]\] roles;
    - \[PM-1(a)(2)[2]\] responsibilities;
    - \[PM-1(a)(2)[3]\] management commitment;
    - \[PM-1(a)(2)[4]\] coordination among organizational entities;
    - \[PM-1(a)(2)[5]\] compliance;

  - \[PM-1(a)(3)\] reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical);
  - \[PM-1(a)(4)\] is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being incurred to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;

- \[PM-1(b)\]

  - \[PM-1(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to review the security program plan for the information system;
  - \[PM-1(b)[2]\] reviews the organization-wide information security program plan with the organization-defined frequency;

- \[PM-1(c)\] updates the plan to address organizational:

  - \[PM-1(c)[1]\] changes identified during plan implementation;
  - \[PM-1(c)[2]\] changes identified during security control assessments;
  - \[PM-1(c)[3]\] problems identified during plan implementation;
  - \[PM-1(c)[4]\] problems identified during security control assessments;

- \[PM-1(d)\] protects the information security program plan from unauthorized:

  - \[PM-1(d)[1]\] disclosure; and
  - \[PM-1(d)[2]\] modification.

## Control guidance

Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organizationâ€™s information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls. Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems.
