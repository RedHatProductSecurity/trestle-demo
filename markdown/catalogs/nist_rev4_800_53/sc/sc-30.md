# sc-30 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Concealment and Misdirection

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sc-30_prm_1 }} for {{ insert: param, sc-30_prm_2 }} at {{ insert: param, sc-30_prm_3 }} to confuse and mislead adversaries.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-30[1]\] defines concealment and misdirection techniques to be employed to confuse and mislead adversaries potentially targeting organizational information systems;

- \[SC-30[2]\] defines information systems for which organization-defined concealment and misdirection techniques are to be employed;

- \[SC-30[3]\] defines time periods to employ organization-defined concealment and misdirection techniques for organization-defined information systems; and

- \[SC-30[4]\] employs organization-defined concealment and misdirection techniques for organization-defined information systems at organization-defined time periods to confuse and mislead adversaries.

## Control guidance

Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection techniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis.
