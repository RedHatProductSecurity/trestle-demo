# sc-28.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Off-line Storage

## Control Statement

The organization removes from online storage and stores off-line in a secure location {{ insert: param, sc-28.2_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-28(2)[1]\] defines information to be removed from online storage and stored off-line in a secure location; and

- \[SC-28(2)[2]\] removes organization-defined information from online storage; and

- \[SC-28(2)[3]\] stores such information off-line in a secure location.

## Control guidance

Removing organizational information from online information system storage to off-line storage eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access to the information through a network. Therefore, organizations may choose to move information to off-line storage in lieu of protecting such information in online storage.
