# sc-3.5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Layered Structures

## Control Statement

The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization implements security functions as a layered structure:

- \[SC-3(5)[1]\] minimizing interactions between layers of the design; and

- \[SC-3(5)[2]\] avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.

## Control guidance

The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions among security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on higher-layer functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of complexity.
