# sc-25 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Thin Nodes

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, sc-25_prm_1 }} with minimal functionality and information storage.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-25[1]\] defines information system components to be employed with minimal functionality and information storage; and

- \[SC-25[2]\] employs organization-defined information system components with minimal functionality and information storage.

## Control guidance

The deployment of information system components with reduced/minimal functionality (e.g., diskless nodes and thin client technologies) reduces the need to secure every user endpoint, and may reduce the exposure of information, information systems, and services to cyber attacks.
