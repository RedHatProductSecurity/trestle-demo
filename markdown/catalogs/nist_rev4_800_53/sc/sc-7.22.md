# sc-7.22 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Separate Subnets for Connecting to Different Security Domains

## Control Statement

The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect to systems in different security domains.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect to systems in different security domains.

## Control guidance

Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains containing information with different security categories or classification levels.
