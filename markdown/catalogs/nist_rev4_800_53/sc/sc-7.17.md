# sc-7.17 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Automated Enforcement of Protocol Formats

## Control Statement

The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.

## Control guidance

Information system components that enforce protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components verify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layers.
