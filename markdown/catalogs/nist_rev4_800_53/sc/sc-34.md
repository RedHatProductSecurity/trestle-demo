# sc-34 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Non-modifiable Executable Programs

## Control Statement

The information system at {{ insert: param, sc-34_prm_1 }}:

- \[a.\] Loads and executes the operating environment from hardware-enforced, read-only media; and

- \[b.\] Loads and executes {{ insert: param, sc-34_prm_2 }} from hardware-enforced, read-only media.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-34[1]\] the organization defines information system components for which the operating environment and organization-defined applications are to be loaded and executed from hardware-enforced, read-only media;

- \[SC-34[2]\] the organization defines applications to be loaded and executed from hardware-enforced, read-only media;

- \[SC-34[3]\] the information system, at organization-defined information system components:

  - \[SC-34[3](a)\] loads and executes the operating environment from hardware-enforced, read-only media; and
  - \[SC-34[3](b)\] loads and executes organization-defined applications from hardware-enforced, read-only media.

## Control guidance

The term operating environment is defined as the specific code that hosts applications, for example, operating systems, executives, or monitors including virtual machine monitors (i.e., hypervisors). It can also include certain applications running directly on hardware platforms. Hardware-enforced, read-only media include, for example, Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R)/Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R) disk drives and one-time programmable read-only memory. The use of non-modifiable storage ensures the integrity of software from the point of creation of the read-only image. The use of reprogrammable read-only memory can be accepted as read-only media provided: (i) integrity can be adequately protected from the point of initial writing to the insertion of the memory into the information system; and (ii) there are reliable hardware protections against reprogramming the memory while installed in organizational information systems.
