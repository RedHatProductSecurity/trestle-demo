# sc-24 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Fail in Known State

## Control Statement

The information system fails to a {{ insert: param, sc-24_prm_1 }} for {{ insert: param, sc-24_prm_2 }} preserving {{ insert: param, sc-24_prm_3 }} in failure.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-24[1]\] the organization defines a known-state to which the information system is to fail in the event of a system failure;

- \[SC-24[2]\] the organization defines types of failures for which the information system is to fail to an organization-defined known-state;

- \[SC-24[3]\] the organization defines system state information to be preserved in the event of a system failure;

- \[SC-24[4]\] the information system fails to the organization-defined known-state for organization-defined types of failures; and

- \[SC-24[5]\] the information system preserves the organization-defined system state information in the event of a system failure.

## Control guidance

Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the mission/business needs of organizations. Failure in a known secure state helps to prevent the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational information systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving information system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of organizations with less disruption of mission/business processes.
