# sc-42.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Authorized Use

## Control Statement

The organization employs the following measures: {{ insert: param, sc-42.2_prm_1 }}, so that data or information collected by {{ insert: param, sc-42.2_prm_2 }} is only used for authorized purposes.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-42(2)[1]\] defines measures to be employed so that data or information collected by sensors is only used for authorized purposes;

- \[SC-42(2)[2]\] defines sensors to be used to collect data or information for authorized purposes only; and

- \[SC-42(2)[3]\] employs organization-defined measures so that data or information collected by organization-defined sensors is only used for authorized purposes.

## Control guidance

Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose potentially could be misused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that are used to support traffic navigation could be misused to track movements of individuals. Measures to mitigate such activities include, for example, additional training to ensure that authorized parties do not abuse their authority, or (in the case where sensor data/information is maintained by external parties) contractual restrictions on the use of the data/information.
