# sc-30.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Change Processing / Storage Locations

## Control Statement

The organization changes the location of {{ insert: param, sc-30.3_prm_1 }} {{ insert: param, sc-30.3_prm_2 }}].

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-30(3)[1]\] defines processing and/or storage locations to be changed at time intervals specified by the organization;

- \[SC-30(3)[2]\] defines a frequency to change the location of organization-defined processing and/or storage; and

- \[SC-30(3)[3]\] changes the location of organization-defined processing and/or storage at one of the following:

  - \[SC-30(3)[3][a]\] organization-defined time intervals; or
  - \[SC-30(3)[3][b]\] random time intervals.

## Control guidance

Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions and the information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational resources.
