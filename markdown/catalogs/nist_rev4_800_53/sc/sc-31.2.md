# sc-31.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Maximum Bandwidth

## Control Statement

The organization reduces the maximum bandwidth for identified covert {{ insert: param, sc-31.2_prm_1 }} channels to {{ insert: param, sc-31.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-31(2)[1]\] defines values to be employed as the maximum bandwidth allowed for identified covert channels; and

- \[SC-31(2)[2]\] reduces the maximum bandwidth to organization-defined values for one or more of the following identified:

  - \[SC-31(2)[2][a]\] covert storage channels; and/or
  - \[SC-31(2)[2][b]\] covert timing channels.

## Control guidance

Information system developers are in the best position to reduce the maximum bandwidth for identified covert storage and timing channels.
