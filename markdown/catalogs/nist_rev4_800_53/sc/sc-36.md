# sc-36 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Distributed Processing and Storage

## Control Statement

The organization distributes {{ insert: param, sc-36_prm_1 }} across multiple physical locations.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-36[1]\] defines processing and storage to be distributed across multiple physical locations; and

- \[SC-36[2]\] distributes organization-defined processing and storage across multiple physical locations.

## Control guidance

Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations provides some degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations, and therefore increases the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. This control does not assume a single primary processing or storage location, and thus allows for parallel processing and storage.
