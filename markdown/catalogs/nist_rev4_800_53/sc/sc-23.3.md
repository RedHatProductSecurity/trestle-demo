# sc-23.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Unique Session Identifiers with Randomization

## Control Statement

The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session with {{ insert: param, sc-23.3_prm_1 }} and recognizes only session identifiers that are system-generated.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-23(3)[1]\] the organization defines randomness requirements for generating a unique session identifier for each session;

- \[SC-23(3)[2]\] the information system generates a unique session identifier for each session with organization-defined randomness requirements; and

- \[SC-23(3)[3]\] the information system recognizes only session identifiers that are system-generated.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from reusing previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers.
