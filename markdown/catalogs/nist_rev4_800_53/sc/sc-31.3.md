# sc-31.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Measure Bandwidth in Operational Environments

## Control Statement

The organization measures the bandwidth of {{ insert: param, sc-31.3_prm_1 }} in the operational environment of the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-31(3)[1]\] defines subset of identified covert channels whose bandwidth is to be measured in the operational environment of the information system; and

- \[SC-31(3)[2]\] measures the bandwidth of the organization-defined subset of identified covert channels in the operational environment of the information system.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses covert channel bandwidth in operational environments versus developmental environments. Measuring covert channel bandwidth in operational environments helps organizations to determine how much information can be covertly leaked before such leakage adversely affects organizational missions/business functions. Covert channel bandwidth may be significantly different when measured in those settings that are independent of the particular environments of operation (e.g., laboratories or development environments).
