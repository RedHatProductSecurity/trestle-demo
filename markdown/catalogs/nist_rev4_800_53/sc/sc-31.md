# sc-31 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Covert Channel Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Performs a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the information system that are potential avenues for covert {{ insert: param, sc-31_prm_1 }} channels; and

- \[b.\] Estimates the maximum bandwidth of those channels.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-31(a)\] performs a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the information system that are potential avenues for one or more of the following:

  - \[SC-31(a)[1]\] covert storage channels; and/or
  - \[SC-31(a)[2]\] covert timing channels; and

- \[SC-31(b)\] estimates the maximum bandwidth of those channels.

## Control guidance

Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within systems that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, for example, in the case of information systems containing export-controlled information and having connections to external networks (i.e., networks not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is also meaningful for multilevel secure (MLS) information systems, multiple security level (MSL) systems, and cross-domain systems.
