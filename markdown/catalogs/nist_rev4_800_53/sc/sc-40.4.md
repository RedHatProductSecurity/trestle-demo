# sc-40.4 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Signal Parameter Identification

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of {{ insert: param, sc-40.4_prm_1 }} by using the transmitter signal parameters.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-40(4)[1]\] the organization defines wireless transmitters for which cryptographic mechanisms are to be implemented to prevent identification of such transmitters by using the transmitter signal parameters; and

- \[SC-40(4)[2]\] the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of organization-defined wireless transmitters by using the transmitter signal parameters.

## Control guidance

Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission/user identification. This control enhancement protects against the unique identification of wireless transmitters for purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting alterations to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. This control enhancement helps assure mission success when anonymity is required.
