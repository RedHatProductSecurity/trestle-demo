# sc-36.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Polling Techniques

## Control Statement

The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to {{ insert: param, sc-36.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-36(1)[1]\] defines distributed processing and storage components for which polling techniques are to be employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises; and

- \[SC-36(1)[2]\] employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to organization-defined distributed processing and storage components.

## Control guidance

Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and information systems. However, distribution of processing and/or storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of the distributed components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the various distributed components and subsequently voting on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and/or storage components.
