# sc-7.5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Deny by Default / Allow by Exception

## Control Statement

The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system, at managed interfaces:

- \[SC-7(5)[1]\] denies network traffic by default; and

- \[SC-7(5)[2]\] allows network traffic by exception.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are allowed.
