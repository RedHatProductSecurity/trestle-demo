# sc-40.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Reduce Detection Potential

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to {{ insert: param, sc-40.2_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-40(2)[1]\] the organization defines level of reduction to be achieved to reduce the detection potential of wireless links; and

- \[SC-40(2)[2]\] the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to organization-defined level of reduction.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement is needed for covert communications and protecting wireless transmitters from being geo-located by their transmissions. The control enhancement ensures that spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve low probability of detection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine the levels to which wireless links should be undetectable.
