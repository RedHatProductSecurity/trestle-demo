# sc-40 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Wireless Link Protection

## Control Statement

The information system protects external and internal {{ insert: param, sc-40_prm_1 }} from {{ insert: param, sc-40_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-40[1]\] the organization defines:

  - \[SC-40[1][a]\] internal wireless links to be protected from particular types of signal parameter attacks;
  - \[SC-40[1][b]\] external wireless links to be protected from particular types of signal parameter attacks;

- \[SC-40[2]\] the organization defines types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks that are based upon exploiting the signal parameters of organization-defined internal and external wireless links; and

- \[SC-40[3]\] the information system protects internal and external organization-defined wireless links from organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks.

## Control guidance

This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users. Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service, or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to implement this control.
