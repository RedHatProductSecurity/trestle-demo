# sc-32 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Information System Partitioning

## Control Statement

The organization partitions the information system into {{ insert: param, sc-32_prm_1 }} residing in separate physical domains or environments based on {{ insert: param, sc-32_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-32[1]\] defines circumstances for physical separation of information system components into information system partitions;

- \[SC-32[2]\] defines information system components to reside in separate physical domains or environments based on organization-defined circumstances for physical separation of components; and

- \[SC-32[3]\] partitions the information system into organization-defined information system components residing in separate physical domains or environments based on organization-defined circumstances for physical separation of components.

## Control guidance

Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components from physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, to components in separate rooms for the more critical components, to more significant geographical separation of the most critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned information system components.
