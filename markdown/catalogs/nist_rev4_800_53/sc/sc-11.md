# sc-11 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Trusted Path

## Control Statement

The information system establishes a trusted communications path between the user and the following security functions of the system: {{ insert: param, sc-11_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-11[1]\] the organization defines security functions of the information system;

- \[SC-11[2]\] the organization-defined security functions include at a minimum, information system authentication and re-authentication; and

- \[SC-11[3]\] the information system establishes a trusted communications path between the user and the organization-defined security functions of the system.

## Control guidance

Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can communicate directly with security functions of information systems with the requisite assurance to support information security policies. The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the security functions of organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for high-assurance connections between security functions of information systems and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept.
