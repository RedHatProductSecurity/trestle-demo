# sc-7.23 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Disable Sender Feedback On Protocol Validation Failure

## Control Statement

The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.

## Control guidance

Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be unavailable.
