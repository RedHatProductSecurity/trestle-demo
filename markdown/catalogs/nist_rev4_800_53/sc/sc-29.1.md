# sc-29.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Virtualization Techniques

## Control Statement

The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of operating systems and applications that are changed {{ insert: param, sc-29.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-29(1)[1]\] defines a frequency to change the diversity of operating systems and applications deployed using virtualization techniques; and

- \[SC-29(1)[2]\] employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of operating systems and applications that are changed with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing virtual operating systems or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. In addition, virtualization techniques can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software and/or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.
