# sc-4.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Periods Processing

## Control Statement

The information system prevents unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with {{ insert: param, sc-4.2_prm_1 }} when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-4(2)[1]\] the organization defines procedures to be employed to ensure unauthorized information transfer via shared resources is prevented when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories; and

- \[SC-4(2)[2]\] the information system prevents unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with organization-defined procedures when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement applies when there are explicit changes in information processing levels during information system operations, for example, during multilevel processing and periods processing with information at different classification levels or security categories. Organization-defined procedures may include, for example, approved sanitization processes for electronically stored information.
