# sc-23.5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Allowed Certificate Authorities

## Control Statement

The information system only allows the use of {{ insert: param, sc-23.5_prm_1 }} for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SC-23(5)[1]\] the organization defines certificate authorities to be allowed for verification of the establishment of protected sessions; and

- \[SC-23(5)[2]\] the information system only allows the use of organization-defined certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.

## Control guidance

Reliance on certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after verification by the respective certificate authorities, facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers.
