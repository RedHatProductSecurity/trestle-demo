# sc-43 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Usage Restrictions

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for {{ insert: param, sc-43_prm_1 }} based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and

- \[b.\] Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of such components within the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SC-43(a)\]

  - \[SC-43(a)[1]\] defines information system components for which usage restrictions and implementation guidance are to be established;
  - \[SC-43(a)[2]\] establishes, for organization-defined information system components:

    - \[SC-43(a)[2][a]\] usage restrictions based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously;
    - \[SC-43(a)[2][b]\] implementation guidance based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously;

- \[SC-43(b)\]

  - \[SC-43(b)[1]\] authorizes the use of such components within the information system;
  - \[SC-43(b)[2]\] monitors the use of such components within the information system; and
  - \[SC-43(b)[3]\] controls the use of such components within the information system.

## Control guidance

Information system components include hardware, software, or firmware components (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, mobile code, digital copiers, printers, scanners, optical devices, wireless technologies, mobile devices).
