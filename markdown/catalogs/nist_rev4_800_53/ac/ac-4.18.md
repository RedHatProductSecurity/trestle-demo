# ac-4.18 - \[Access Control\] Security Attribute Binding

## Control Statement

The information system binds security attributes to information using {{ insert: param, ac-4.18_prm_1 }} to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-4(18)[1]\] the organization defines binding techniques to be used to facilitate information flow policy enforcement; and

- \[AC-4(18)[2]\] the information system binds security attributes to information using organization-defined binding techniques to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.

## Control guidance

Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the strength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations.
