# ac-16.6 - \[Access Control\] Maintenance of Attribute Association by Organization

## Control Statement

The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_2 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-16(6)[1]\] defines security attributes to be associated with subjects and objects;

- \[AC-16(6)[2]\] defines subjects and objects to be associated with organization-defined security attributes;

- \[AC-16(6)[3]\] defines security policies to allow personnel to associate, and maintain the association of organization-defined security attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects; and

- \[AC-16(6)[4]\] allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of organization-defined security attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects in accordance with organization-defined security policies.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with subjects and objects.
