# ac-16.8 - \[Access Control\] Association Techniques / Technologies

## Control Statement

The information system implements {{ insert: param, ac-16.8_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.8_prm_2 }} in associating security attributes to information.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-16(8)[1]\] the organization defines techniques or technologies to be implemented in associating security attributes to information;

- \[AC-16(8)[2]\] the organization defines level of assurance to be provided when the information system implements organization-defined technologies or technologies to associate security attributes to information; and

- \[AC-16(8)[3]\] the information system implements organization-defined techniques or technologies with organization-defined level of assurance in associating security attributes to information.

## Control guidance

The association (i.e., binding) of security attributes to information within information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such security attributes can be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For example, information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information using digital signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).
