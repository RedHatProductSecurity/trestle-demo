# ac-16.5 - \[Access Control\] Attribute Displays for Output Devices

## Control Statement

The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify {{ insert: param, ac-16.5_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, ac-16.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-16(5)[1]\] the organization identifies special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions to be used for each object that the information system transmits to output devices;

- \[AC-16(5)[2]\] the organization identifies human-readable, standard naming conventions for the security attributes to be displayed in human-readable form on each object that the information system transmits to output devices; and

- \[AC-16(5)[3]\] the information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify organization-identified special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions using organization-identified human readable, standard naming conventions.

## Control guidance

Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers and video displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal digital assistants.
