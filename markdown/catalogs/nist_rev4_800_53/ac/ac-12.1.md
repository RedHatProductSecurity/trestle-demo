# ac-12.1 - \[Access Control\] User-initiated Logouts / Message Displays

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[(a)\] Provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever authentication is used to gain access to {{ insert: param, ac-12.1_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of authenticated communications sessions.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-12(1)(a)\]

  - \[AC-12(1)(a)[1]\] the organization defines information resources for which user authentication is required to gain access to such resources;
  - \[AC-12(1)(a)[2]\] the information system provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever authentication is used to gain access to organization-defined information resources; and

- \[AC-12(1)(b)\] the information system displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of authenticated communications sessions.

## Control guidance

Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include, for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/web-based services. Logout messages for web page access, for example, can be displayed after authenticated sessions have been terminated. However, for some types of interactive sessions including, for example, file transfer protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating sessions.
