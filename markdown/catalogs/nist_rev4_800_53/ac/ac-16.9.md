# ac-16.9 - \[Access Control\] Attribute Reassignment

## Control Statement

The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only via re-grading mechanisms validated using {{ insert: param, ac-16.9_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-16(9)[1]\] defines techniques or procedures to validate re-grading mechanisms used to reassign association of security attributes with information; and

- \[AC-16(9)[2]\] ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only via re-grading mechanisms validated using organization-defined techniques or procedures.

## Control guidance

Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to provide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The validation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of limited function. Since security attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is necessary to ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.
