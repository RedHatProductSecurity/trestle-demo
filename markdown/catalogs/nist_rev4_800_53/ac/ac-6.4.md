# ac-6.4 - \[Access Control\] Separate Processing Domains

## Control Statement

The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.

## Control guidance

Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation mechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains.
