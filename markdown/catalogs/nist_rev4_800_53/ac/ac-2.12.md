- \[(b)\] Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to {{ insert: param, ac-2.12_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

  - \[AC-2(12)(a)[1]\] defines atypical usage to be monitored for information system accounts;
  - \[AC-2(12)(a)[2]\] monitors information system accounts for organization-defined atypical usage;

- \[AC-2(12)(b)\]

  - \[AC-2(12)(b)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to whom atypical usage of information system accounts are to be reported; and
  - \[AC-2(12)(b)[2]\] reports atypical usage of information system accounts to organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals working in organizations.
