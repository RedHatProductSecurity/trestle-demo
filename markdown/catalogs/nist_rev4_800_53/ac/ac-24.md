# ac-24 - \[Access Control\] Access Control Decisions

## Control Statement

The organization establishes procedures to ensure {{ insert: param, ac-24_prm_1 }} are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-24[1]\] defines access control decisions to be applied to each access request prior to access control enforcement; and

- \[AC-24[2]\] establishes procedures to ensure organization-defined access control decisions are applied to each access request prior to access control enforcement.

## Control guidance

Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs when information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed information systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.
