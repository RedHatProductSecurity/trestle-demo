# ac-18.5 - \[Access Control\] Antennas / Transmission Power Levels

## Control Statement

The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-18(5)[1]\] selects radio antennas to reduce the probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries; and

- \[AC-18(5)[2]\] calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.

## Control guidance

Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include, for example: (i) reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters of organizations; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; and (iii) using directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.
