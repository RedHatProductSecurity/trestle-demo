# ac-18 - \[Access Control\] Wireless Access

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and

- \[b.\] Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-18(a)\] establishes for wireless access:

  - \[AC-18(a)[1]\] usage restrictions;
  - \[AC-18(a)[2]\] configuration/connection requirement;
  - \[AC-18(a)[3]\] implementation guidance; and

- \[AC-18(b)\] authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control guidance

Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
