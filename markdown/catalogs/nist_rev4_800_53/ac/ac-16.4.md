# ac-16.4 - \[Access Control\] Association of Attributes by Authorized Individuals

## Control Statement

The information system supports the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.4_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.4_prm_2 }} by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AC-16(4)[1]\] the organization defines security attributes to be associated with subjects and objects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals);

- \[AC-16(4)[2]\] the organization defines subjects and objects requiring the association of organization-defined security attributes by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals); and

- \[AC-16(4)[3]\] the information system supports the association of organization-defined security attributes with organization-defined subjects and objects by authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).

## Control guidance

The support provided by information systems can vary to include: (i) prompting users to select specific security attributes to be associated with specific information objects; (ii) employing automated mechanisms for categorizing information with appropriate attributes based on defined policies; or (iii) ensuring that the combination of selected security attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of security attributes when defining auditable events.
