## Control Statement

The information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) the capability to define or change the value of associated security attributes.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf on individuals) the capability to define or change the value of associated security attributes.

## Control guidance

The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to authorized individuals.
