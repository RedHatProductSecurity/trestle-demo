# ac-2.13 - \[Access Control\] Disable Accounts for High-risk Individuals

## Control Statement

The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within {{ insert: param, ac-2.13_prm_1 }} of discovery of the risk.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-2(13)[1]\] defines the time period within which accounts are disabled upon discovery of a significant risk posed by users of such accounts; and

- \[AC-2(13)[2]\] disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within the organization-defined time period of discovery of the risk.

## Control guidance

Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution of this control enhancement.
