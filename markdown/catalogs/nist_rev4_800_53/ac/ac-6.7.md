# ac-6.7 - \[Access Control\] Review of User Privileges

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Reviews {{ insert: param, ac-6.7_prm_1 }} the privileges assigned to {{ insert: param, ac-6.7_prm_2 }} to validate the need for such privileges; and

- \[(b)\] Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-6(7)(a)\]

  - \[AC-6(7)(a)[1]\] defines roles or classes of users to which privileges are assigned;
  - \[AC-6(7)(a)[2]\] defines the frequency to review the privileges assigned to organization-defined roles or classes of users to validate the need for such privileges;
  - \[AC-6(7)(a)[3]\] reviews the privileges assigned to organization-defined roles or classes of users with the organization-defined frequency to validate the need for such privileges; and

- \[AC-6(7)(b)\] reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational missions/business needs.

## Control guidance

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.
