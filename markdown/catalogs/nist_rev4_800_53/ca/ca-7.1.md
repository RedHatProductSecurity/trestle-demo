# ca-7.1 - \[Security Assessment and Authorization\] Independent Assessment

## Control Statement

The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with {{ insert: param, ca-7.1_prm_1 }} to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CA-7(1)[1]\] defines a level of independence to be employed to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis; and

- \[CA-7(1)[2]\] employs assessors or assessment teams with the organization-defined level of independence to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

## Control guidance

Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.
