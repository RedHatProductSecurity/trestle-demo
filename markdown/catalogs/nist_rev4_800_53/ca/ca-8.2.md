# ca-8.2 - \[Security Assessment and Authorization\] Red Team Exercises

## Control Statement

The organization employs {{ insert: param, ca-8.2_prm_1 }} to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with {{ insert: param, ca-8.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CA-8(2)[1]\] defines red team exercises to be employed to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems;

- \[CA-8(2)[2]\] defines rules of engagement for employing organization-defined red team exercises; and

- \[CA-8(2)[3]\] employs organization-defined red team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with organization-defined rules of engagement.

## Control guidance

Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security state of information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational missions/business functions and the information systems that support those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business processes) and social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations). While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing, organizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security awareness and training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness.
