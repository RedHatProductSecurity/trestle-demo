# ca-9 - \[Security Assessment and Authorization\] Internal System Connections

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Authorizes internal connections of {{ insert: param, ca-9_prm_1 }} to the information system; and

- \[b.\] Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[CA-9(a)\]

  - \[CA-9(a)[1]\] defines information system components or classes of components to be authorized as internal connections to the information system;
  - \[CA-9(a)[2]\] authorizes internal connections of organization-defined information system components or classes of components to the information system;

- \[CA-9(b)\] documents, for each internal connection:

  - \[CA-9(b)[1]\] the interface characteristics;
  - \[CA-9(b)[2]\] the security requirements; and
  - \[CA-9(b)[3]\] the nature of the information communicated.

## Control guidance

This control applies to connections between organizational information systems and (separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections) including, for example, system connections with mobile devices, notebook/desktop computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual internal connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of components with common characteristics and/or configurations, for example, all digital printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, storage, and transmission capability or all smart phones with a specific baseline configuration.
