# au-10.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Validate Binding of Information Producer Identity

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[(a)\] Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at {{ insert: param, au-10.2_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Performs {{ insert: param, au-10.2_prm_2 }} in the event of a validation error.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-10(2)(a)\]

  - \[AU-10(2)(a)[1]\] the organization defines the frequency to validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information;
  - \[AU-10(2)(a)[2]\] the information system validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at the organization-defined frequency; and

- \[AU-10(2)(b)\]

  - \[AU-10(2)(b)[1]\] the organization defines actions to be performed in the event of a validation error; and
  - \[AU-10(2)(b)[2]\] the information system performs organization-defined actions in the event of a validation error.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.
