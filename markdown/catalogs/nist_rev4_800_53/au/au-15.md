# au-15 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Alternate Audit Capability

## Control Statement

The organization provides an alternate audit capability in the event of a failure in primary audit capability that provides {{ insert: param, au-15_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-15[1]\] defines alternative audit functionality to be provided in the event of a failure in primary audit capability; and

- \[AU-15[2]\] provides an alternative audit capability in the event of a failure in primary audit capability that provides organization-defined alternative audit functionality.

## Control guidance

Since an alternate audit capability may be a short-term protection employed until the failure in the primary auditing capability is corrected, organizations may determine that the alternate audit capability need only provide a subset of the primary audit functionality that is impacted by the failure.
