# au-6.6 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Correlation with Physical Monitoring

## Control Statement

The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Control guidance

The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individualâ€™s identity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.
