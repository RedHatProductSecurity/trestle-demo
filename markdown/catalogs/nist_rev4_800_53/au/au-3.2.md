# au-3.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Centralized Management of Planned Audit Record Content

## Control Statement

The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by {{ insert: param, au-3.2_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-3(2)[1]\] the organization defines information system components that generate audit records whose content is to be centrally managed and configured by the information system; and

- \[AU-3(2)[2]\] the information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by the organization-defined information system components.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and configuration capability provided by the information system.
