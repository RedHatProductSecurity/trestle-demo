# au-6.7 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Permitted Actions

## Control Statement

The organization specifies the permitted actions for each {{ insert: param, au-6.7_prm_1 }} associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit information.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization specifies the permitted actions for each one or more of the following associated with the review, analysis and reporting of audit information:

- \[AU-6(7)[1]\] information system process;

- \[AU-6(7)[2]\] role; and/or

- \[AU-6(7)[3]\] user.

## Control guidance

Organizations specify permitted actions for information system processes, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the information system and include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.
