# au-10.4 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Validate Binding of Information Reviewer Identity

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[(a)\] Validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between {{ insert: param, au-10.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Performs {{ insert: param, au-10.4_prm_2 }} in the event of a validation error.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-10(4)(a)\]

  - \[AU-10(4)(a)[1]\] the organization defines security domains for which the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information is to be validated at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between such domains;
  - \[AU-10(4)(a)[2]\] the information system validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between organization-defined security domains;

- \[AU-10(4)(b)\]

  - \[AU-10(4)(b)[1]\] the organization defines actions to be performed in the event of a validation error; and
  - \[AU-10(4)(b)[2]\] the information system performs organization-defined actions in the event of a validation error.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between review and transfer/release. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.
