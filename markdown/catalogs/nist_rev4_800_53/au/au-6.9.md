# au-6.9 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Correlation with Information from Nontechnical Sources

## Control Statement

The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

## Control guidance

Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to initiating such actions.
