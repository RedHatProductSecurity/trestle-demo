# au-16.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Sharing of Audit Information

## Control Statement

The organization provides cross-organizational audit information to {{ insert: param, au-16.2_prm_1 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-16.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-16(2)[1]\] defines organizations with whom cross-organizational audit information is to be shared;

- \[AU-16(2)[2]\] defines cross-organizational sharing agreements to be used when providing cross-organizational audit information to organization-defined organizations; and

- \[AU-16(2)[3]\] provides cross-organizational audit information to organization-defined organizations based on organization-defined cross-organizational sharing agreements.

## Control guidance

Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.
