## Control Statement

The organization enforces dual authorization for {{ insert: param, au-9.5_prm_1 }} of {{ insert: param, au-9.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AU-9(5)[2]\] defines one or more of the following types of operations on audit information for which dual authorization is to be enforced:

  - \[AU-9(5)[2][a]\] movement; and/or
  - \[AU-9(5)[2][b]\] deletion; and

- \[AU-9(5)[3]\] enforces dual authorization for the movement and/or deletion of organization-defined audit information.

## Control guidance

Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized individuals in order to execute. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control.
