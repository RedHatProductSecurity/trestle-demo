# au-4.1 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Transfer to Alternate Storage

## Control Statement

The information system off-loads audit records {{ insert: param, au-4.1_prm_1 }} onto a different system or media than the system being audited.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[AU-4(1)[1]\] the organization defines the frequency to off-load audit records onto a different system or media than the system being audited; and

- \[AU-4(1)[2]\] the information system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media than the system being audited with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred.
