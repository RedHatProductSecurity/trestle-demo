# si-4.7 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Automated Response to Suspicious Events

## Control Statement

The information system notifies {{ insert: param, si-4.7_prm_1 }} of detected suspicious events and takes {{ insert: param, si-4.7_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SI-4(7)[1]\] the organization defines incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) to be notified of detected suspicious events;

- \[SI-4(7)[2]\] the organization defines least-disruptive actions to be taken by the information system to terminate suspicious events;

- \[SI-4(7)[3]\] the information system notifies organization-defined incident response personnel of detected suspicious events; and

- \[SI-4(7)[4]\] the information system takes organization-defined least-disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events.

## Control guidance

Least-disruptive actions may include, for example, initiating requests for human responses.
