# si-13.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Manual Transfer Between Components

## Control Statement

The organization manually initiates transfers between active and standby information system components {{ insert: param, si-13.3_prm_1 }} if the mean time to failure exceeds {{ insert: param, si-13.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-13(3)[1]\] defines the minimum frequency with which the organization manually initiates a transfer between active and standby information system components if the mean time to failure exceeds the organization-defined time period;

- \[SI-13(3)[2]\] defines the time period that the mean time to failure must exceed before the organization manually initiates a transfer between active and standby information system components; and

- \[SI-13(3)[3]\] manually initiates transfers between active and standby information system components at the organization-defined frequency if the mean time to failure exceeds the organization-defined time period.
