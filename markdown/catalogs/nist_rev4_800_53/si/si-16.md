# si-16 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Memory Protection

## Control Statement

The information system implements {{ insert: param, si-16_prm_1 }} to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[SI-16[1]\] the organization defines security safeguards to be implemented to protect information system memory from unauthorized code execution; and

- \[SI-16[2]\] the information system implements organization-defined security safeguards to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

## Control guidance

Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.
