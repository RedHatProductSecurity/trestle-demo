# si-7.13 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Code Execution in Protected Environments

## Control Statement

The organization allows execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources with limited or no warranty and without the provision of source code only in confined physical or virtual machine environments and with the explicit approval of {{ insert: param, si-7.13_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-7(13)[1]\] allows execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources with limited or no warranty;

- \[SI-7(13)[2]\] allows execution of binary or machine-executable code without the provision of source code only in confined physical or virtual machines;

- \[SI-7(13)[3]\] defines personnel or roles required to provide explicit approval to allow execution of binary or machine-executable code; and

- \[SI-7(13)[4]\] allows execution of binary or machine-executable code with the explicit approval of organization-defined personnel or roles.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source software.
