# si-7.11 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Confined Environments with Limited Privileges

## Control Statement

The organization requires that {{ insert: param, si-7.11_prm_1 }} execute in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-7(11)[1]\] defines user-installed software to be executed in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges; and

- \[SI-7(11)[2]\] requires that organization-defined user-installed software execute in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.

## Control guidance

Organizations identify software that may be of greater concern with regard to origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user installations occur in confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from malicious code that may be executed.
