# si-13.5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Failover Capability

## Control Statement

The organization provides {{ insert: param, si-13.5_prm_1 }} {{ insert: param, si-13.5_prm_2 }} for the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-13(5)[1]\] defines failover capability to be provided for the information system;

- \[SI-13(5)[2]\] provides one of the following organization-defined failover capabilities for the information system:

  - \[SI-13(5)[2][a]\] real-time failover capability; and/or
  - \[SI-13(5)[2][b]\] near real-time failover capability.

## Control guidance

Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate information system upon the failure of the primary information system. Failover capability includes, for example, incorporating mirrored information system operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by recovery time periods of organizations.
