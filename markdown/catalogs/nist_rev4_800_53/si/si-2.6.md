# si-2.6 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Removal of Previous Versions of Software / Firmware

## Control Statement

The organization removes {{ insert: param, si-2.6_prm_1 }} after updated versions have been installed.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-2(6)[1]\]

  - \[SI-2(6)[1][a]\] defines software components to be removed after updated versions have been installed;
  - \[SI-2(6)[1][b]\] defines firmware components to be removed after updated versions have been installed;

- \[SI-2(6)[2]\]

  - \[SI-2(6)[2][a]\] removes organization-defined software components after updated versions have been installed; and
  - \[SI-2(6)[2][b]\] removes organization-defined firmware components after updated versions have been installed.

## Control guidance

Previous versions of software and/or firmware components that are not removed from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions of software and/or firmware automatically from the information system.
