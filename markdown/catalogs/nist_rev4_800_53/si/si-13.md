# si-13 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Predictable Failure Prevention

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for {{ insert: param, si-13_prm_1 }} in specific environments of operation; and

- \[b.\] Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and standby components at {{ insert: param, si-13_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-13(a)\]

  - \[SI-13(a)[1]\] defines information system components for which mean time to failure (MTTF) should be determined;
  - \[SI-13(a)[2]\] determines MTTF for organization-defined information system components in specific environments of operation;

- \[SI-13(b)\]

  - \[SI-13(b)[1]\] defines MTTF substitution criteria to be used as a means to exchange active and standby components;
  - \[SI-13(b)[2]\] provides substitute information system components at organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria; and
  - \[SI-13(b)[3]\] provides a means to exchange active and standby components at organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria.

## Control guidance

While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential failures of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for substitution of information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for resulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability (e.g., preservation of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.
