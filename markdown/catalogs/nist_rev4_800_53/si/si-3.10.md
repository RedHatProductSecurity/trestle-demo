# si-3.10 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Malicious Code Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Employs {{ insert: param, si-3.10_prm_1 }} to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code; and

- \[(b)\] Incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into organizational incident response and flaw remediation processes.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-3(10)(a)\]

  - \[SI-3(10)(a)[1]\] defines tools and techniques to be employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code;
  - \[SI-3(10)(a)[2]\] employs organization-defined tools and techniques to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code; and

- \[SI-3(10)(b)\] incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into incident response and flaw remediate processes.

## Control guidance

The application of selected malicious code analysis tools and techniques provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific instances of malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious code facilitates more effective organizational responses to current and future threats. Organizations can conduct malicious code analyses by using reverse engineering techniques or by monitoring the behavior of executing code.
