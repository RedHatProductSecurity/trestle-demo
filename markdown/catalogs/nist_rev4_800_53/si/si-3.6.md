# si-3.6 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Testing / Verification

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Tests malicious code protection mechanisms {{ insert: param, si-3.6_prm_1 }} by introducing a known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system; and

- \[(b)\] Verifies that both detection of the test case and associated incident reporting occur.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-3(6)(a)\]

  - \[SI-3(6)(a)[1]\] defines a frequency to test malicious code protection mechanisms;
  - \[SI-3(6)(a)[2]\] tests malicious code protection mechanisms with the organization-defined frequency by introducing a known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system;

- \[SI-3(6)(b)\]

  - \[SI-3(6)(b)[1]\] verifies that detection of the test case occurs; and
  - \[SI-3(6)(b)[2]\] verifies that associated incident reporting occurs.
