# si-10.5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Restrict Inputs to Trusted Sources and Approved Formats

## Control Statement

The organization restricts the use of information inputs to {{ insert: param, si-10.5_prm_1 }} and/or {{ insert: param, si-10.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-10(5)[1]\] defines trusted sources to which the use of information inputs is to be restricted;

- \[SI-10(5)[2]\] defines formats to which the use of information inputs is to be restricted;

- \[SI-10(5)[3]\] restricts the use of information inputs to:

  - \[SI-10(5)[3][a]\] organization-defined trust sources; and/or
  - \[SI-10(5)[3][b]\] organization-defined formats.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to information inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable formats for such inputs can reduce the probability of malicious activity.
