# si-7.7 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Integration of Detection and Response

## Control Statement

The organization incorporates the detection of unauthorized {{ insert: param, si-7.7_prm_1 }} into the organizational incident response capability.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-7(7)[1]\] defines unauthorized security-relevant changes to the information system; and

- \[SI-7(7)[2]\] incorporates the detection of unauthorized organization-defined security-relevant changes to the information system into the organizational incident response capability.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement helps to ensure that detected events are tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes. Maintaining historical records is important both for being able to identify and discern adversary actions over an extended period of time and for possible legal actions. Security-relevant changes include, for example, unauthorized changes to established configuration settings or unauthorized elevation of information system privileges.
