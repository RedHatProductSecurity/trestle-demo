# si-4.17 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Integrated Situational Awareness

## Control Statement

The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization, to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness, correlates information from monitoring:

- \[SI-4(17)[1]\] physical activities;

- \[SI-4(17)[2]\] cyber activities; and

- \[SI-4(17)[3]\] supply chain activities.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a more diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates the various cyber monitoring information, this control enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors.
