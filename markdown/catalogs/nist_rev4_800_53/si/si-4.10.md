# si-4.10 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Visibility of Encrypted Communications

## Control Statement

The organization makes provisions so that {{ insert: param, si-4.10_prm_1 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-4.10_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[SI-4(10)[1]\] defines encrypted communications traffic required to be visible to information system monitoring tools;

- \[SI-4(10)[2]\] defines information system monitoring tools to be provided access to organization-defined encrypted communications traffic; and

- \[SI-4(10)[3]\] makes provisions so that organization-defined encrypted communications traffic is visible to organization-defined information system monitoring tools.

## Control guidance

Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications traffic is paramount; for others, mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.
