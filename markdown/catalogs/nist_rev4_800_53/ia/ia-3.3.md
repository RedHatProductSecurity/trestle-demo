# ia-3.3 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Dynamic Address Allocation

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Standardizes dynamic address allocation lease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with {{ insert: param, ia-3.3_prm_1 }}; and

- \[(b)\] Audits lease information when assigned to a device.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-3(3)(a)\]

  - \[IA-3(3)(a)[1]\] defines lease information to be employed to standardize dynamic address allocation for devices;
  - \[IA-3(3)(a)[2]\] defines lease duration to be employed to standardize dynamic address allocation for devices;
  - \[IA-3(3)(a)[3]\] standardizes dynamic address allocation of lease information assigned to devices in accordance with organization-defined lease information;
  - \[IA-3(3)(a)[4]\] standardizes dynamic address allocation of the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with organization-defined lease duration; and

- \[IA-3(3)(b)\] audits lease information when assigned to a device.

## Control guidance

DHCP-enabled clients obtaining leases for IP addresses from DHCP servers, is a typical example of dynamic address allocation for devices.
