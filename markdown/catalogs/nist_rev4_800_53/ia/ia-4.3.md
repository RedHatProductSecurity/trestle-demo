# ia-4.3 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Multiple Forms of Certification

## Control Statement

The organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification be presented to the registration authority.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics be presented to the registration authority.

## Control guidance

Requiring multiple forms of identification, such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the work factor of potential adversaries.
