# ia-8.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of Third-party Credentials

## Control Statement

The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement typically applies to organizational information systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites. Third-party credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions initiative. Approved third-party credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. This allows federal government relying parties to trust such credentials at their approved assurance levels.
