# ia-11 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Re-authentication

## Control Statement

The organization requires users and devices to re-authenticate when {{ insert: param, ia-11_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-11[1]\] defines circumstances or situations requiring re-authentication;

- \[IA-11[2]\] requires users to re-authenticate when organization-defined circumstances or situations require re-authentication; and

- \[IA-11[3]\] requires devices to re-authenticate when organization-defined circumstances or situations require re-authentication.

## Control guidance

In addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require re-authentication of individuals and/or devices in other situations including, for example: (i) when authenticators change; (ii), when roles change; (iii) when security categories of information systems change; (iv), when the execution of privileged functions occurs; (v) after a fixed period of time; or (vi) periodically.
