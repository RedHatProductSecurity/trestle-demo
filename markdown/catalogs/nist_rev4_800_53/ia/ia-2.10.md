# ia-2.10 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Single Sign-on

## Control Statement

The information system provides a single sign-on capability for {{ insert: param, ia-2.10_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[IA-2(10)[1]\] the organization defines a list of information system accounts and services for which a single sign-on capability must be provided; and

- \[IA-2(10)[2]\] the information system provides a single sign-on capability for organization-defined information system accounts and services.

## Control guidance

Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple information system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by single sign-on capabilities with the increased risk from disclosures of single authenticators providing access to multiple system resources.
