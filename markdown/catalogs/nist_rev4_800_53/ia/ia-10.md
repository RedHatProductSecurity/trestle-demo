# ia-10 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Adaptive Identification and Authentication

## Control Statement

The organization requires that individuals accessing the information system employ {{ insert: param, ia-10_prm_1 }} under specific {{ insert: param, ia-10_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[IA-10[1]\] defines specific circumstances or situations that require individuals accessing the information system to employ supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms;

- \[IA-10[2]\] defines supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms to be employed when accessing the information system under specific organization-defined circumstances or situations; and

- \[IA-10[3]\] requires that individuals accessing the information system employ organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms under specific organization-defined circumstances or situations.

## Control guidance

Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal duties, roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals would routinely access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses). In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed.
