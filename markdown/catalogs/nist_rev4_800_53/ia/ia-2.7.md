# ia-2.7 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Network Access to Non-privileged Accounts - Separate Device

## Control Statement

The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access and the device meets {{ insert: param, ia-2.7_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[IA-2(7)[1]\] the information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access;

- \[IA-2(7)[2]\] the organization defines strength of mechanism requirements to be enforced by a device separate from the system gaining network access to non-privileged accounts; and

- \[IA-2(7)[3]\] the information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts such that a device, separate from the system gaining access, meets organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements.
