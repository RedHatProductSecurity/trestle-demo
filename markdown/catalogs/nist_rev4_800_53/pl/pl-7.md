# pl-7 - \[Planning\] Security Concept of Operations

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the information system containing at a minimum, how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security; and

- \[b.\] Reviews and updates the CONOPS {{ insert: param, pl-7_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PL-7(a)\] develops a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the information system containing at a minimum, how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security;

- \[PL-7(b)\]

  - \[PL-7(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the security CONOPS; and
  - \[PL-7(b)[2]\] reviews and updates the security CONOPS with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

The security CONOPS may be included in the security plan for the information system or in other system development life cycle-related documents, as appropriate. Changes to the CONOPS are reflected in ongoing updates to the security plan, the information security architecture, and other appropriate organizational documents (e.g., security specifications for procurements/acquisitions, system development life cycle documents, and systems/security engineering documents).
