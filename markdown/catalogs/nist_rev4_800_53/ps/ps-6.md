# ps-6 - \[Personnel Security\] Access Agreements

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops and documents access agreements for organizational information systems;

- \[b.\] Reviews and updates the access agreements {{ insert: param, ps-6_prm_1 }}; and

- \[c.\] Ensures that individuals requiring access to organizational information and information systems:

  - \[1.\] Sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access; and
  - \[2.\] Re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational information systems when access agreements have been updated or {{ insert: param, ps-6_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-6(a)\] develops and documents access agreements for organizational information systems;

- \[PS-6(b)\]

  - \[PS-6(b)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the access agreements;
  - \[PS-6(b)[2]\] reviews and updates the access agreements with the organization-defined frequency;

- \[PS-6(c)\]

  - \[PS-6(c)(1)\] ensures that individuals requiring access to organizational information and information systems sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access;
  - \[PS-6(c)(2)\]

    - \[PS-6(c)(2)[1]\] defines the frequency to re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational information systems when access agreements have been updated;
    - \[PS-6(c)(2)[2]\] ensures that individuals requiring access to organizational information and information systems re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational information systems when access agreements have been updated or with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand, and agree to abide by the constraints associated with organizational information systems to which access is authorized. Organizations can use electronic signatures to acknowledge access agreements unless specifically prohibited by organizational policy.
