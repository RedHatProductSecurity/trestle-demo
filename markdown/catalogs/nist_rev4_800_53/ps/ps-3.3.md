- \[(b)\] Satisfy {{ insert: param, ps-3.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-3(3)(a)\] ensures that individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection have valid access authorizations that are demonstrated by assigned official government duties;

- \[PS-3(3)(b)\]

  - \[PS-3(3)(b)[1]\] defines additional personnel screening criteria to be satisfied for individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection; and
  - \[PS-3(3)(b)[2]\] ensures that individuals accessing an information system processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection satisfy organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria.

## Control guidance

Organizational information requiring special protection includes, for example, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Sources and Methods Information (SAMI). Personnel security criteria include, for example, position sensitivity background screening requirements.
