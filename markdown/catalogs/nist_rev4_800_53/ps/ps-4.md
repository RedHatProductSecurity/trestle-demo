  - \[PS-4(c)[2]\] conducts exit interviews that include a discussion of organization-defined information security topics;

- \[PS-4(d)\] retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property;

- \[PS-4(e)\] retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by the terminated individual;

- \[PS-4(f)\]

  - \[PS-4(f)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be notified of the termination;
  - \[PS-4(f)[2]\] defines the time period within which to notify organization-defined personnel or roles; and
  - \[PS-4(f)[3]\] notifies organization-defined personnel or roles within the organization-defined time period.

## Control guidance

Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.
