# ps-4.2 - \[Personnel Security\] Automated Notification

## Control Statement

The organization employs automated mechanisms to notify {{ insert: param, ps-4.2_prm_1 }} upon termination of an individual.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[PS-4(2)[1]\] defines personnel or roles to be notified upon termination of an individual; and

- \[PS-4(2)[2]\] employs automated mechanisms to notify organization-defined personnel or roles upon termination of an individual.

## Control guidance

In organizations with a large number of employees, not all personnel who need to know about termination actions receive the appropriate notificationsâ€”or, if such notifications are received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated mechanisms can be used to send automatic alerts or notifications to specific organizational personnel or roles (e.g., management personnel, supervisors, personnel security officers, information security officers, systems administrators, or information technology administrators) when individuals are terminated. Such automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety of ways, including, for example, telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via websites.
