## Importing/Authoring Workflow

`compliance-trestle` workspace content is updated by one of three inputs:

1. Human authoring and submission via pull request (PR). 

2. External machine agent opens draft PR

3. GitHub Actions polling of authoritative sources opens draft PR when updates are found. 

Once `compliance-trestle` workspace content modifications have been merged into the `compliance-trestle` workspace, a series of synchronization actions are performed on the `compliance-trestle` workspace with GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions opens a Draft PR on the `compliance-trestle` workspace as an step between each synchronization action. An authorized user reviews the Draft PRs

        Sync(Sync OSCAL Implementation and Control Layers)
    end

        Pull_Request(Pull Request)
    end

    Catalog_Profile_Import --> Draft_PR
    Component_Build_Pipelines --> Draft_PR
    Trestle_Workspace --> Sync
    Sync --> Draft_PR
    Draft_PR --> Pull_Request
```

## Reporting Workflow

The `compliance-trestle` utility can be used to generate custom reports from OSCAL formatted content by referencing templates and optional additional front-matter. A user interacts with the trestle utility to generate these reports in various formats. 

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Trestle_Workspace
        OSCAL_Content(OSCAL Content)
        Front_Matter(Front Matter)
        Report_Templates(Report Templates)
    end
    Trestle_Utility(Trestle Utility)
    SSP_Reports(SSP Reports)
    POAM_Reports(POA&M Reports)

    Report_Templates --> Trestle_Utility
    Person --> Trestle_Utility
    Trestle_Utility --> SSP_Reports
    Trestle_Utility --> POAM_Reports
```

## Assessment Workflow

OSCAL Assessment Plans are imported to a policy agent from the `compliance-trestle` workspace. Once the policy agent has performed its assessment as per the Assessment Plan, it produces an Assessment Result and exports the Assessment Result to the `compliance-trestle` workspace as a Draft PR. An authorized user then reviews the Draft PR, converts it to a Pull Request, and then conditionally approves it to be merged into the `compliance-trestle` workspace. 

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Compliance Content Management Workspace
        Trestle_Workspace(compliance-trestle workspace)
        Assessment_Plan(Assessment Plan)
        Draft_PR(Draft PR)
        PR(Pull Request)
    end
    subgraph Assessment
        Policy_Engine(Policy Engine)
    end
