# Context Diagram

This diagram is a depiction of the end-to-end compliance content management automation as demonstrated within this repository. 

GitHub Actions is used to import catalog and profile content from external sources. When this content is imported, it starts a series of automated tasks hosted in GitHub Actions that synchronize all of the `compliance-trestle` workspace's content. Each content type synchronization generates a draft pull request, which is then submitted for review to the `compliance-trestle` workspace.

Component Definitions are automatically exported from their respective application build pipelines and submitted via pull request to the `compliance-trestle` workspace. Authorized parties then review and conditionally approve the submitted Component Definitions.

System Security Plans (SSPs) are initially created by authorized parties and then receive automatic synchronizations of Control and Component Definitions as those content modifications become available.
